<h2 class="lsp">PREFACE.</h2>

<div class="fs90">
<p class="noindent">The character and credit of the British Army must chiefly
depend upon the zeal and ardour, by which all who enter
into its service are animated, and consequently it is of the
highest importance that any measure calculated to excite the
spirit of emulation, by which alone great and gallant actions
are achieved, should be adopted.</p>

<p>Nothing can more fully tend to the accomplishment of this
desirable object, than a full display of the noble deeds with
which the Military History of our country abounds. To hold
forth these bright examples to the imitation of the youthful
soldier, and thus to incite him to emulate the meritorious
conduct of those who have preceded him in their honourable
career, are among the motives that have given rise to the
present publication.</p>

<p>The operations of the British Troops are, indeed, announced
in the 'London Gazette,' from whence they are transferred
into the public prints: the achievements of our armies are thus
made known at the time of their occurrence, and receive the
tribute of praise and admiration to which they are entitled.
On extraordinary occasions, the Houses of Parliament have
been in the habit of conferring on the Commanders, and the
Officers and Troops acting under their orders, expressions of
approbation and of thanks for their skill and bravery, and these
testimonials, confirmed by the high honour of their Sovereign's
Approbation, constitute the reward which the soldier most
highly prizes.</p>

<p>It has not, however, until late years, been the practice (which
appears to have long prevailed in some of the Continental
armies) for British Regiments to keep regular records of their
services and achievements. Hence some difficulty has been
experienced in obtaining, particularly from the old Regiments,
an authentic account of their origin and subsequent services.</p>

<p>This defect will now be remedied, in consequence of His
Majesty having been pleased to command, that every Regiment
shall in future keep a full and ample record of its services at
home and abroad.</p>

<p>From the materials thus collected, the country will henceforth
derive information as to the difficulties and privations
which chequer the career of those who embrace the military
profession. In Great Britain, where so large a number of
persons are devoted to the active concerns of agriculture,
manufactures, and commerce, and where these pursuits have,
for so long a period, been undisturbed by the <em>presence of war</em>,
which few other countries have escaped, comparatively little
is known of the vicissitudes of active service, and of the
casualties of climate, to which, even during peace, the British
Troops are exposed in every part of the globe, with little or
no interval of repose.</p>

<p>In their tranquil enjoyment of the blessings which the
country derives from the industry and the enterprise of the agriculturist
and the trader, its happy inhabitants may be supposed
not often to reflect on the perilous duties of the soldier and
the sailor,&mdash;on their sufferings,&mdash;and on the sacrifice of valuable
life, by which so many national benefits are obtained
and preserved.</p>

<p>The conduct of the British Troops, their valour, and endurance,
have shone conspicuously under great and trying difficulties;
and their character has been established in Continental
warfare by the irresistible spirit with which they have effected
debarkations in spite of the most formidable opposition, and
by the gallantry and steadiness with which they have maintained
their advantages against superior numbers.</p>

<p>In the official Reports made by the respective Commanders,
ample justice has generally been done to the gallant exertions
of the Corps employed; but the details of their services, and
of acts of individual bravery, can only be fully given in the
Annals of the various Regiments.</p>

<p>These Records are now preparing for publication, under
His Majesty's special authority, by Mr. <span class="smcap">Richard Cannon</span>,
Principal Clerk of the Adjutant-General's Office; and while
the perusal of them cannot fail to be useful and interesting to
military men of every rank, it is considered that they will also
afford entertainment and information to the general reader,
particularly to those who may have served in the Army, or
who have relatives in the Service.</p>

<p>There exists in the breasts of most of those who have served,
or are serving, in the Army, an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Esprit du Corps</i>&mdash;an attachment
to every thing belonging to their Regiment; to such
persons a narrative of the services of their own Corps cannot
fail to prove interesting. Authentic accounts of the actions
of the great,&mdash;the valiant,&mdash;the loyal, have always been of
paramount interest with a brave and civilised people. Great
Britain has produced a race of heroes who, in moments of
danger and terror, have stood, "firm as the rocks of their
native shore;" and when half the World has been arrayed
against them, they have fought the battles of their Country
with unshaken fortitude. It is presumed that a record of
achievements in war,&mdash;victories so complete and surprising,
gained by our countrymen,&mdash;our brothers&mdash;our fellow-citizens
in arms,&mdash;a record which revives the memory of the brave,
and brings their gallant deeds before us, will certainly prove
acceptable to the public.</p>

<p>Biographical memoirs of the Colonels and other distinguished
Officers, will be introduced in the Records of their respective
Regiments, and the Honorary Distinctions which have, from
time to time, been conferred upon each Regiment, as testifying
the value and importance of its services, will be faithfully
set forth.</p>

<p>As a convenient mode of Publication, the Record of each
Regiment will be printed in a distinct number, so that when
the whole shall be completed, the Parts may be bound up in
numerical succession.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<hr class="r15" />

<p class="noindent">The ancient Armies of England were composed
of Horse and Foot; but the feudal troops established
by William the Conqueror in 1086, consisted
almost entirely of Horse. Under the feudal
system, every holder of land amounting to what
was termed a "knight's fee," was required to
provide a charger, a coat of mail, a helmet, a
shield, and a lance, and to serve the Crown a
period of forty days in each year at his own
expense; and the great landholders had to provide
armed men in proportion to the extent of
their estates; consequently the ranks of the feudal
Cavalry were completed with men of property,
and the vassals and tenants of the great barons,
who led their dependents to the field in person.</p>

<p>In the succeeding reigns the Cavalry of the
Army was composed of Knights (or men at arms)
and Hobiliers (or horsemen of inferior degree);
and the Infantry of spear and battle-axe men,
cross-bowmen, and archers. The Knights wore
armour on every part of the body, and their
weapons were a lance, a sword, and a small
dagger. The Hobiliers were accoutred and armed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[ii]</a></span>
for the light and less important services of war,
and were not considered qualified for a charge in
line. Mounted Archers<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> were also introduced,
and the English nation eventually became pre-eminent
in the use of the bow.</p>

<p>About the time of Queen Mary the appellation
of "<em>Men at Arms</em>" was changed to that of "<em>Spears</em>
and <em>Launces</em>." The introduction of fire-arms ultimately
occasioned the lance to fall into disuse,
and the title of the Horsemen of the first degree
was changed to "<em>Cuirassiers</em>." The Cuirassiers
were armed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cap-à-pié</i>, and their weapons were a
sword with a straight narrow blade and sharp
point, and a pair of large pistols, called petrenels;
and the Hobiliers carried carbines. The Infantry
carried pikes, matchlocks, and swords. The
introduction of fire-arms occasioned the formation
of regiments armed and equipped as infantry,
but mounted on small horses for the sake of
expedition of movement, and these were styled
"<em>Dragoons</em>;" a small portion of the military
force of the kingdom, however, consisted of this
description of troops.</p>

<p>The formation of the present Army commenced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[iii]</a></span>
after the Restoration in 1660, with the establishment
of regular corps of Horse and Foot; the
Horsemen were cuirassiers, but only wore armour
on the head and body; and the Foot were pikemen
and musketeers. The arms which each
description of force carried, are described in the
following extract from the "Regulations of King
Charles II.," dated 5th May, 1663:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Each Horseman to have for his defensive
armes, back, breast, and pot; and for his offensive
armes, a sword, and a case of pistolls, the
barrels whereof are not to be und<sup>r</sup>. foorteen
inches in length; and each Trooper of Our
Guards to have a carbine, besides the aforesaid
armes. And the Foote to have each souldier a
sword, and each pikeman a pike of 16 foote
long and not und<sup>r</sup>.; and each musqueteer a
musquet, with a collar of bandaliers, the barrels
of which musquet to be about foor foote long,
and to conteine a bullet, foorteen of which shall
weigh a pound weight<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>."</p></div>

<p>The ranks of the Troops of Horse were at this
period composed of men of some property&mdash;generally
the sons of substantial yeomen: the young
men received as recruits provided their own horses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
and they were placed on a rate of pay sufficient
to give them a respectable station in society.</p>

<p>On the breaking out of the war with Holland,
in the spring of 1672, a Regiment of Dragoons
was raised<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>; the Dragoons were placed on a lower
rate of pay than the Horse; and the Regiment
was armed similar to the Infantry, excepting that
a limited number of the men carried halberds
instead of pikes, and the others muskets and bayonets;
and a few men in each Troop had pistols;
as appears by a warrant dated the 2nd of April,
1672, of which the following is an extract:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span class="smcap">Charles R.</span></p>

<p class="in2">"Our will and pleasure is, that a Regiment
of Dragoones which we have established
and ordered to be raised, in twelve Troopes of
fourscore in each beside officers, who are to be
under the command of Our most deare and most
intirely beloved Cousin Prince Rupert, shall
be armed out of Our stoares remaining within
Our office of the Ordinance, as followeth; that
is to say, three corporalls, two serjeants, the
gentlemen at armes, and twelve souldiers of
each of the said twelve Troopes, are to have and
carry each of them one halbard, and one case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
of pistolls with holsters; and the rest of the
souldiers of the several Troopes aforesaid, are
to have and to carry each of them one matchlocke
musquet, with a collar of bandaliers, and
also to have and to carry one bayonet<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>, or great
knife. That each lieutenant have and carry
one partizan; and that two drums be delivered
out for each Troope of the said Regiment<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>."</p></div>

<p>Several regiments of Horse and Dragoons were
raised in the first year of the reign of King
James II.; and the horsemen carried a short carbine<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
in addition to the sword and pair of pistols:
and in a Regulation dated the 21st of February,
1687, the arms of the Dragoons at that period are
commanded to be as follow:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Dragoons to have snaphanse musquets,
strapt, with bright barrels of three foote eight
inches long, cartouch-boxes, bayonetts, granado
pouches, bucketts, and hammer-hatchetts."</p></div>

<p>After several years' experience, little advantage
was found to accrue from having Cavalry Regiments
formed almost exclusively for engaging the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>enemy on foot; and, the Horse having laid aside
their armour, the arms and equipment of Horse
and Dragoons were so nearly assimilated, that
there remained little distinction besides the name
and rate of pay. The introduction of improvements
into the mounting, arming, and equipment
of Dragoons rendered them competent to the
performance of every description of service required
of Cavalry; and, while the long musket
and bayonet were retained, to enable them to act
as Infantry, if necessary, they were found to be
equally efficient, and of equal value to the nation,
as Cavalry, with the Regiments of Horse.</p>

<p>In the several augmentations made to the
regular Army after the early part of the reign of
Queen Anne, no new Regiments of Horse were
raised for permanent service; and in 1746 King
George II. reduced three of the old Regiments
of Horse to the quality and pay of Dragoons; at
the same time, His Majesty gave them the title of
First, Second, and Third Regiments of <em>Dragoon
Guards</em>: and in 1788 the same alteration was
made in the remaining four Regiments of Horse,
which then became the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and
Seventh Regiments of <em>Dragoon Guards</em>.</p>

<p>At present there are only three Regiments
which are styled <em>Horse</em> in the British Army,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
namely, the two Regiments of Life Guards, and
the Royal Regiment of Horse Guards, to whom
cuirasses have recently been restored. The other
Cavalry Regiments consist of Dragoon Guards,
Heavy and Light Dragoons, Hussars, and Lancers;
and although the long musket and bayonet have
been laid aside by the whole of the Cavalry, and
the Regiments are armed and equipped on the
principle of the old Horse (excepting the cuirass),
they continue to be styled Dragoons.</p>

<p>The old Regiments of Horse formed a highly
respectable and efficient portion of the Army,
and it is found, on perusing the histories of the
various campaigns in which they have been engaged,
that they have, on all occasions, maintained
a high character for steadiness and discipline, as
well as for bravery in action. They were formerly
mounted on horses of superior weight and physical
power, and few troops could withstand a
well-directed charge of the celebrated British
Horse. The records of these corps embrace a
period of 150 years&mdash;a period eventful in history,
and abounding in instances of heroism displayed
by the British troops when danger has threatened
the nation,&mdash;a period in which these Regiments
have numbered in their ranks men of loyalty,
valour, and good conduct, worthy of imitation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span></p>

<p>Since the Regiments of Horse were formed
into Dragoon Guards, additional improvements
have been introduced into the constitution of the
several corps; and the superior description of
horses now bred in the United Kingdom enables
the commanding officers to remount their regiments
with such excellent horses, that, whilst
sufficient weight has been retained for a powerful
charge in line, a lightness has been acquired which
renders them available for every description of
service incident to modern warfare.</p>

<p>The orderly conduct of these Regiments in
quarters has gained the confidence and esteem of
the respectable inhabitants of the various parts of
the United Kingdom in which they have been
stationed; their promptitude and alacrity in attending
to the requisitions of the magistrates in
periods of excitement, and the temper, patience,
and forbearance which they have evinced when
subjected to great provocation, insult, and violence
from the misguided populace, prove the value of
these troops to the Crown, and to the Government
of the country, and justify the reliance which is
reposed on them.</p>

<p class="noindent">In the month of June, 1685, when the Duke of
Monmouth raised the standard of rebellion in the
west of England, many of the nobility and
gentry displayed their loyalty by raising forces
for the service of their Sovereign; and during
the alarm and consternation which prevailed
throughout the country, Thomas Earl of Plymouth,&mdash;a
nobleman highly distinguished for loyalty
and attachment to the crown,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>&mdash;a veteran who
had fought the battles of his King against
the forces of Cromwell,&mdash;raised a troop of horse
in Worcestershire; another troop was raised by
Claudius Earl of Abercorn in Oxfordshire; a
third by Henry Lord Eyland at St. Alban's
and its vicinity; a fourth by Henry Lord Grey
at Dunstable and other towns in Bedfordshire;
a fifth by Lionel Walden, Esq., at Huntingdon
and its vicinity; and a sixth by Mr. Ambrose
Brown in the neighbourhood of Dorking;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
and, when the decisive battle of Sedgemoor,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>with the capture and execution of the Duke of
Monmouth, had destroyed the hopes of the disaffected,
the six troops raised by the above distinguished
noblemen and gentlemen were incorporated
into a regiment, which ranked as <span class="smcap">Fourth
Horse</span>; and the corps thus formed having been
continued in the service of the crown until the
present time, it is now distinguished by the title
of the <span class="smcap">Third, or Prince of Wales' Regiment
of Dragoon Guards</span>, and the various operations
in which it has been engaged, with the part it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
taken in battles, sieges, and other occurrences,
through many eventful periods of history, form
the subject of this brief memoir.</p>

<p>The Colonelcy was conferred on the Earl of
Plymouth, by commission dated the 15th of July,
1685, and the Lieut.-Colonelcy on Hugh Sunderland,
an officer of experience, who had been
Major of the Royal Dragoons since 1683. The
<span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> were armed and equipped as
<span class="smcap">Cuirassiers</span>.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The men wore hats with broad
brims, bound with silver lace, turned up on one
side and ornamented with green ribands; scarlet
coats lined with green shalloon, and high boots
made of jacked leather; they had also scarlet
cloaks lined with green, and green horse-furniture
embroidered with white, and ornamented with
the King's cypher and crown. Their cuirasses
were pistol-proof, and they had also iron headpieces
called potts. Their weapons were a sword,
a pair of pistols, and a short carbine; and, thus
equipped, these loyal yeomen had a formidable
and warlike appearance. In a few weeks after
the regiment was formed, it marched into quarters
in Buckinghamshire (viz., to Amersham, Aylesbury,
and Marlow), and, having been instructed
in the plain and simple exercises practised at that
period, it was reviewed on the 20th of August by
the King on Hounslow Heath, and again on the
22nd of that month.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>
<p>After these reviews the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> marched
into winter quarters at several towns in Gloucestershire;
and it is a curious particular in the
annals of the regiment, that the first service it was
called upon to perform was enforcing obedience to
an Act of Parliament which prohibited the cultivation
of tobacco. The increased consumption
and high price of this article had induced several
landholders to cultivate it on their farms, in violation
of the law, particularly at Winchcomb and
the villages in that neighbourhood. One troop
was stationed for a short time at Winchcomb expressly
for the purpose of preventing the cultivation
of this herb; and when the men left that
town the following paragraph appeared in the
order for their march: 'Our further will and
pleasure is, that you cause parties to be sent,
once at least in every week, to our town of
Winchcomb and places adjacent, who are hereby
ordered to destroy all plants, seeds, and leaves
of tobacco which they shall, upon the strictest
search, find planted or growing contrary to the
Act of Parliament.'<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1686</div>

<p>During its stay in Gloucestershire, the first
inspection of the regiment was made by Brigadier-General
Sir John Lanier, one of the inspecting-generals
of cavalry; and the establishment of the
regiment, with the rates of pay of each rank, was
fixed by a warrant under the sign manual, bearing
date the 1st of January, 1686, from which the
following is an extract:&mdash;</p>

<p>Immediately after the establishment was finally
arranged, the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> were ordered to
march into quarters in the metropolis, where they
arrived in February, 1686, to assist the Life
Guards in the duties of the court; at the same
time a detachment of one officer and six men proceeded
to Liverpool to convey the specie collected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
by the officers of the revenue at that port from
thence to London; which was probably a very
necessary service, as the King, by doubling the
strength of his regular army, had made a great
increase in his expenditure.</p>

<p>During the summer of this year the regiment
was encamped on Hounslow Heath, where it was
several times reviewed by the King, and afterwards
went into quarters at Cambridge, Huntingdon,
and St. Ives.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1687</div>

<p>In the summer of 1687 the regiment was again
quartered for a short time in London, and it was
subsequently encamped on Hounslow Heath,
where a series of reviews and mock-battles were
performed by the troops in presence of the court.
The King spent much of his time on the Heath
witnessing the exercise of the several corps, and
endeavouring to ingratiate himself in the affections
of his army, in order to render it subservient in
the execution of his designs against the established
religion and laws of the country.</p>

Fourth Horse, 1687. Constituted Third Dragoon Guards in 1746. <span class="pad2">[</span>To face page 6.</div>
</div>

<p>On the 3rd of November, in this year, the
Earl of Plymouth died, and the Colonelcy of the
<span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> was given to Brigadier-General
Sir John Fenwick, who had for several years held
the appointment of Lieut.-Colonel of the Second
Troop, now Second Regiment, of Life Guards;
he was also one of the inspecting generals of
cavalry, and was known to be firmly attached to
the King, and a zealous supporter of the measures
of the court. Several officers resigned their commissions,
and they were replaced by men whose
principles were presumed to be favourable to papacy
and absolute monarchy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1688</div>

<p>Although the nation was at peace, and arts
and manufactures were prospering, yet the minds
of the people were troubled, for they saw the King
proceeding with rapid progress towards effecting
the overthrow of the established religion and laws
of the kingdom; while the nobility appeared resolved
to make a stand against the arbitrary measures
of the court. Thus, the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>,
when they had been only three years in the service
of the crown, found themselves in a most
perplexing situation; yet their conduct was so
truly honourable, that every individual who has
served in the corps may reflect with exultation
on the fact that, throughout the whole period of
its service, its reputation has been preserved untarnished.
In the summer of 1688 it again
erected its tents on Hounslow Heath; and, several
Bishops having been imprisoned and brought to
trial for not acquiescing in the King's measures,
on the day they were acquitted, his Majesty, after
reviewing the army on the Heath, dined in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Earl of Feversham's tent when, on a sudden,
the soldiers began to shout and huzza; the King
inquired the cause of the noise, and was answered&mdash;'Nothing,
your Majesty, but the soldiers shouting
because the Bishops are acquitted.' The
King answered, with evident displeasure, 'Call
you that nothing?' and dismissed the troops to
their quarters, resolving (according to the historians
of that period) never to call them together
again until he had remodelled them, by the dismissal
of protestants and the introduction of papists.
But events were ripe for execution; and
the Prince of Orange was, in compliance with the
solicitations of the English nobility, preparing an
expedition for England to support the established
religion and laws.</p>

<p>When the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> left Hounslow
Heath, they proceeded into quarters at Oxford
and Woodstock. In the beginning of November
they marched to Alresford; and when the Prince
of Orange landed at Torbay, they were ordered
to advance to Salisbury, where King James's
army was assembled; before leaving Alresford,
the men, in consequence of an order from the
Secretary-at-War, placed their <span class="fs80">ARMOUR</span> under
the charge of the civil authorities of the town,
from whence it was subsequently removed to the
Tower of London.</p>

<p>King James arrived at Salisbury to command
the forces in person, where he again discovered
the reluctance of the troops to support the proceedings
of the jesuitical faction by which he was
governed; and, alarmed by the desertions which
took place, he fled to London and ultimately to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
France. Several corps went over to the Prince
of Orange; but the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> preserved
their fidelity to King James until that unhappy
monarch forsook the throne; and when the Prince
assumed the reins of government, His Highness
ordered the regiment to march to Dorking and
Ryegate, where it received a draught of 100 men
and horses from the Marquis de Miremont's<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> regiment
of horse, a newly-raised corps which was
ordered to be disbanded.</p>

<p>Sir John Fenwick, adhering to the interest of
King James, resigned his commission; and the
Colonelcy of the regiment was given to Lord
Colchester, from the Lieutenant-Colonelcy of the
Fourth Troop of Life Guards, who was one of the
first officers that joined the Prince of Orange at
Exeter, and took with him several men of his
troop.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1689</div>

<p>After the flight of the King, the Roman
Catholic soldiers committed some irregularities;
and in January, 1689, a squadron of the <span class="smcap">Fourth
Horse</span>, with a detachment of Sir George Hewyt's
Horse (now Sixth Dragoon Guards), marched to
Lewes and Chichester, where they caused three
regiments of Irish Roman Catholics<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> to lay down
their arms, and afterwards escorted them to Portsmouth;
from whence they were removed, under a
strong guard, to the Isle of Wight, and were subsequently,
sent to Hamburg, and disposed of in the
service of the Emperor of Germany.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>In the mean time the accession of King William
and Queen Mary to the throne was opposed in
Scotland, and Viscount Dundee was actively engaged
in exciting the northern shires, particularly
the Highlanders, to take arms in favour of King
James. The <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>, after transferring
thirty men and horses to the Blues (which regiment
was ordered to proceed to Holland), marched
for Scotland, and were placed under the command
of Major-General Mackay.</p>

<p>Having arrived at Edinburgh early in April,
the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> formed part of the force employed
in the siege of the castle, which the Duke
of Gordon held possession of for King James.
Shortly afterwards one squadron of the regiment,
with two squadrons of the Royal Scots Dragoons
(the Greys), and two hundred foot, accompanied
Major-General Mackay to the town of Dundee,
where two troops of the Royal Scots Dragoons
were left, and the remainder proceeded in quest
of the rebels.</p>

<p>Major-General Mackay having ascertained that
Viscount Dundee had joined Macdonald of Keppoch,
who lay before Inverness with a thousand
men, determined to confront them with his little
band. He crossed the Spey, and advanced to
Elgin with all possible speed, and throughout the
march he was rejoiced (as he observes in his
memoirs) to find his troops animated with the
same spirit as himself.</p>

<p>At Elgin the squadron of the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>
halted two days in quarters of refreshment, the
men and horses being nearly exhausted. On the
third day they proceeded towards Forres, and on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the march the General ascertained that Viscount
Dundee had taken the road through Badenoch to
Lochaber. The squadron then proceeded to Inverness,
where Major-General Mackay invited
the influential persons in the neighbourhood to
meet him to concert measures for opposing the
rebels; and, expecting that Viscount Dundee
would soon appear with a vast accession of force,
several additional corps were ordered from Edinburgh
to Inverness. At the same time the remainder
of the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> were also directed
to proceed to the same destination.</p>

<p>On the 28th of May the squadron of the regiment
at Inverness, with some other troops, in all
640 men, accompanied General Mackay in his
advance towards Ruthven Castle, where he expected
to meet Colonel Ramsay with 600 Dutch
infantry from Edinburgh; but before the general
reached the Castle, he ascertained that Ramsay
had been intimidated by the threatening aspect of
the Athol men, and finding himself in a wild
country, to which he was a stranger, surrounded
by enemies, he had returned towards Perth: at
the same time General Mackay was informed that
Viscount Dundee with 2000 hardy mountaineers
had arrived that morning at the heights of Badenoch.
Under these perplexing circumstances,
Mackay turned to the left; then, proceeding down
Strathspey, he continued his march for twenty-four
hours without a halt; when, having attained
a considerable distance in advance of the enemy,
he slackened his pace, and was soon afterwards
joined by two troops of the Royal Scots Dragoons
from the town of Dundee. In the mean time, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
enemy followed with all possible expedition, and
on their near approach, General Mackay ascertained
that several of his officers carried on a
secret correspondence with Viscount Dundee, at
the same time he had reason to doubt the fidelity
of the Scots dragoons. The general, having only
the squadron of the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> and a few
Dutch infantry and Scots irregulars on whom he
could depend, once more found himself in a perplexing
situation; and, not deeming it prudent to
march through an hostile country&mdash;all papists,
with an enemy at his heels four times more numerous
than his own little detachment&mdash;he commenced
his march, at dusk in the evening, by the
side of the river, with hungry men and hungry
horses, though resolute, particularly the squadron
of the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>, and 200 fusileers, on
whom he principally relied.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> On arriving at
Balveny, the troops halted to procure bread for
the men and oats for the horses. Having, however,
sent out scouts, and none of them returning,
General Mackay ordered his party to march forward
before the bread was baked, or the horses
had eaten a feed of corn, nor halted until four
o'clock on the next morning, when neither cavalry
nor infantry were able to proceed. However,
after two hours' rest, during which time the horses
were permitted to feed in a field of corn, he proceeded
three miles farther, and took post at the
foot of Suy Hill, where he had a view for two
miles in every direction in which the enemy could
approach. Here the men had some repose, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
their provisions being exhausted, a further supply
was sent for from a house in the neighbourhood
belonging to the Lord Forbes; but before the
food was prepared the general found it necessary
to resume his march. On the same day he was
joined by Berkeley's (now Fourth) Dragoons,
and Leslie's (now Fifteenth) Regiment of Foot.
Thus reinforced he resolved to confront the enemy;
but the Highlanders, though not inferior in numbers
to the King's forces, made a precipitate retreat,
and the troops pursued them from the low
country until they took refuge in the wilds of
Lochaber. The <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> afterwards returned
to the lowlands for refreshment, of which
they stood in great need: having in this, their
first campaign, undergone the greatest fatigues
and privation with a constancy and patience, which
occasioned General Mackay, who was an officer
of much experience, to speak of them in terms of
commendation.</p>

<p>The enemy, though compelled to retire, was
not to be despised. The lofty, chivalrous spirit of
Viscount Dundee rose superior to ordinary difficulties,
and he was engaged in arousing the
friends of the Stuarts to arms. At the same time
General Mackay was at Edinburgh procuring
supplies; and, having given directions for a considerable
body of troops to assemble at Perth, he
proceeded thither without delay. Here he received
intelligence of the enemy's increasing numbers,
and, although his cavalry had not joined him
(excepting two troops of newly-raised horse), he
resolved to march forward, with a view of preventing
the entry of the Highlanders into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
country of Athol. The result was the unfortunate
battle of Killicrankie; in narrating which
the General observes, in reference to the latter part
of the action, '<em>that if he had had but fifty resolute
horse such as</em> <span class="smcap">Colchester's</span> (the <span class="smcap">Fourth</span>)
<em>with him, he had certainly, by all human appearance,
recovered the day</em>,'<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> which shows the very
high opinion he entertained of the regiment.</p>

<p>Two days after this action, in which Viscount
Dundee was killed, and the command of the
mountaineers devolved on Brigadier-General Cannon,
the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> joined General Mackay,
who proceeded with the reinforcements he received
towards <em>St. Johnston</em>, to prevent the junction
of the disaffected in the shires of Perth and
Angus with the rebels, and to keep the latter to
the hills. When on this march, a squadron of the
regiment highly distinguished itself in an action
with a detachment of the enemy, and fully verified
the previous commendatory assertions of General
Mackay in behalf of the corps. The particulars
of this encounter are as follow.</p>

<p>A detachment of rebels, consisting of two
troops of horse and about three hundred foot, had
seized, at St. Johnston, a quantity of provision,
with which they were proceeding to the main
body of their army, about seven miles distant;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
but they were overtaken by Major-General Mackay
at the head of a squadron of the <span class="smcap">Fourth
Horse</span> and some dragoons, who, regardless of
the enemy's numbers, dashed forward with signal
intrepidity,&mdash;charged and defeated the rebel horse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>in gallant style,&mdash;then rushed upon their foot, and,
having broken their ranks, and sabred one hundred
and twenty on the spot, the rest were either
dispersed or taken prisoners.</p>

<p>This casual encounter produced important results.
The enemy, disheartened by the repulse,
proceeded towards the north, keeping near the
Grampian Hills; and General Mackay with 1400
horse and dragoons marched along the plains at
the base of the hills, to restrain the enemy from
descending. In this service the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>
were subject to many harassing marches and
counter-marches. By day the troops were perpetually
in motion; during the night they lay in
the fields in a body; and their commander having
no confidence in the reports of the country people,
who were nearly all hostile to the existing government,
he was continually sending out small parties
throughout the night to procure intelligence. At
length the enemy retreated over the mountains by
paths inaccessible to cavalry, and many of the
Highlanders proceeded to their homes.</p>

<p>The regiment having sustained considerable
loss in this campaign from fatigue and privation,
particularly in horses, marched into England to
recruit, and was quartered at Warwick and Stratford-upon-Avon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1690</div>

<p>Having completed its ranks to the numbers
borne on the establishment, the regiment marched
to the vicinity of the metropolis, and in June,
1690, it furnished a relay of escorts to attend the
King to Highlake, in Cheshire, where His Majesty
embarked for Ireland, in order to rescue that
kingdom from the power of King James. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
regiment was subsequently employed in assisting
the Life Guards in their attendance on the court;
for several months it furnished a daily guard for
the Queen-Dowager, at Windsor; and one troop
afterwards accompanied Her Majesty to Newmarket.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1691</div>

<p>From the south of England the regiment
marched in the spring of 1691 to Lancashire; but
it returned to the south in November of the same
year, and on the 25th of that month received
orders to embark for foreign service.</p>

<p>King William was actively engaged in a war
with Louis XIV., who used every means to promote
the aggrandizement of France. The <span class="smcap">Fourth
Horse</span> formed part of a reinforcement sent to
the British army on the Continent; and, after
landing at Williamstadt in North Brabant, they
marched to Flanders, and went into village cantonments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1692</div>

<p>On the 23rd of January, 1692, John Lord
Berkeley was appointed Colonel of the regiment,
in succession to Lord Colchester, who was promoted
to the command of the Third Troop of Life
Guards.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor"><ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: this anchor was missing">[16]</ins></a></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> were called from their
cantonments in the spring of 1692, to engage in
active operations; and they formed part of the
army commanded by King William in person,
which advanced to the relief of Namur, when that
fortress was besieged by the French. But on
arriving at the banks of the Mehaine, that river
was found impassable from heavy rains; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
enemy arriving on the opposite bank, the two
armies viewed each other across the river, but no
action took place; and while the army was thus
delayed, Namur fell into the hands of the enemy.
The <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> were subsequently engaged
in several manœuvres; and they took part in the
attack of the French in their position near <em>Steenkirk</em>,
on the 3rd of August.</p>

<p>On this occasion they formed part of the leading
column which, after passing along several
narrow defiles and through some woody grounds,
deployed on a small plain in front of the enemy,
and commenced the attack in gallant style; but
not being sustained by the main army, the corps
in advance, after gaining considerable advantage
and displaying great valour, were obliged to retire.
The <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>, after driving back some
French squadrons, had advanced to the right
skirts of a wood on the left wing, and their
gallant bearing, under a heavy fire which thinned
the ranks, was conspicuous; but they were eventually
forced from their ground by the torrent of
superior numbers which came pouring down upon
their front. The King ordered a retreat, and
the troops performed the difficult operation of
retiring through a broken country in presence of
an army of superior numbers, in fine order.</p>

<p>After several marches and changes of position,
the regiment proceeded to Ghent, where it was
joined by a draft of men and horses from the
Princess Anne's Horse, commanded by Colonel
Francis Langston,&mdash;a regiment which, having
suffered severely at Steenkirk, was discontinued
on the establishment of the army, and the few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
remaining men and horses were transferred to
other corps.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1693</div>

<p>Leaving their cantonments in the spring of
1693, the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> again took the field,
and were with the army in Park camp,&mdash;a strong
post which covered Louvain, Malines, and Brussels,&mdash;and
the occupation of this ground enabled King
William to defeat the designs of the enemy on
Brabant. The <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> were subsequently
engaged in several manœuvres, designed to insure
the preservation of the bishopric of Liege, and
to raise the siege of Huy,&mdash;a strong town, pleasantly
situated in a valley on the Maese; but this
fortress was surrendered while the troops were
marching to its relief, and the governor was
brought to trial for surrendering it.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> were afterwards encamped
near the banks of the Geete, in South Brabant,
where the army was attacked by a French force
of superior numbers commanded by the Duke of
Luxembourg. The regiment was posted on this occasion
towards the left of the line, near the village
of <em>Neer-Landen</em>, to support the infantry in this
quarter, and passed the night before the action
under arms.</p>

<p>On the 19th of July, as the first rays of morning
light glanced upon the hostile armies, the
French were discovered in order of battle, and a
sudden burst of artillery from the batteries of the
allies sent forward a shower of balls, which, rending
the ranks of the enemy, formed a prelude to
the sanguinary conflict which followed. For
some time the fighting was limited to the infantry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and artillery, and the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> were spectators
of the fray; yet a cannon shot or two occasionally
plunging into the ranks, laid several
troopers and their horses dead on the plain. At
length the enemy forced the right of the allied
army, and routed the Hanoverian and other foreign
horse in that quarter, when King William ordered
to their aid the British squadrons on the left. Instantly
moving from their post, the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>
and other English cavalry gallopped to the scene
of conflict, and each squadron charging the moment
it arrived, the torrent of battle, which was
sweeping the plain, was stayed,&mdash;the leading squadrons
of the enemy were broken,&mdash;and the British
horsemen, mixing fiercely in the combat, displayed
their native valour and intrepidity. Yet the cavalry
and infantry on the right wing, having
already quitted the field, the chivalrous horsemen
of Britain were unable to resist the superior numbers
of the enemy which came pouring down on
every side; and they were ordered to retire, a
movement which was not executed without some
confusion and considerable loss.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The French
remained masters of the field, but the number of
their killed and wounded exceeded that of the
allies.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>, having retired from the
field of battle by the bridge at Neer-Hespen, proceeded
that night to Tirlemont. They were subsequently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>encamped near Brussels, and after taking
part in several manœuvres and skirmishes, they
returned to their former station at Ghent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1694</div>

<p>On the 24th January, 1694, King William conferred
the Colonelcy on Lieut.-Colonel Cornelius
Wood (an officer of signal merit, who had frequently
distinguished himself), from the Seventh
Horse, now Sixth Dragoon Guards.</p>

<p>After passing the winter at Ghent, the <span class="smcap">Fourth
Horse</span> again took the field in May, 1694, and,
after several marches, were encamped with the
army on the plain near Mont St. André, where
they were reviewed by the King on the 16th of
August, in brigade with the regiments of Leveson,
Wyndham, and Galway.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> They passed the summer
in manœuvring and skirmishing on the verdant
plains of the Netherlands, and on the frontiers
of Liege,&mdash;performing many long and toilsome
marches through a country which, having for several
years been the seat of war, was changed
from a land of smiling plenty and contentment to
a scene of outrage, devastation, and misery. After
forming part of the covering army during the
siege of <em>Huy</em>, which surrendered in September,
the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> marched back to Flanders,
and again occupied quarters at Ghent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1695</div>

<p>In the spring of 1695 thirty men per troop
were suddenly called out of quarters to take the
field; but after a reconnoissance towards the
enemy's frontiers, where they were erecting some
extensive lines of defence, the detachment returned
to its former quarters. In May the regiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
marched out of Ghent, and taking its post in the
right wing of the army, encamped at Arseele, was
reviewed by the King, with the other English
cavalry, on the 31st of that month. In June the
regiment was removed from the right to the left
wing of the army;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and when King William
had, by skilful manœuvres, drawn the enemy to
the Flanders side of their line of entrenchments,
and invested the strong fortress of <em>Namur</em>, the
<span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> formed part of the force detached,
under the Earl of Athlone, towards Fleurus, for
the convenience of forage, and to observe the enemy
on that side. While on this service they were
several weeks in comfortable quarters, or moving
quietly from village to village,&mdash;the horses feeding
on the grassy plains of Hainault,&mdash;the detached
parties patrolling along the front, to observe the
motions of the enemy; meanwhile the infantry
were encamped between Deynse and Thielt, and
the besieging force made rapid progress. At
length, owing to some movements of the enemy,
the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> proceeded towards Bruges;
they subsequently made several forced marches,
and towards the end of July were encamped on
the undulating grounds between Genappe and
Waterloo. Two powerful armies were at this
period manœuvring, and while the French advanced
with confidence to raise the siege of
<em>Namur</em>, the allies interposed to cover the besieging
force. In the course of these manœuvres the
<span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> moved to the vicinity of <em>Namur</em>,
and after the surrender of the citadel they marched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
to the neighbourhood of Nivelles, and were subsequently
encamped at Halle, from whence they
proceeded in the autumn to their former station
at Ghent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1696</div>

<p>During the summer of 1696 the <span class="smcap">Fourth
Horse</span> and Wyndham's Regiment (now 6th
Dragoon Guards) formed part of the army in
Brabant, under King William in person, while
the remainder of the British cavalry continued in
Flanders. For this purpose the two regiments
left Ghent on the 1st of June, and having joined
the main army on the march near Gemblours on
the 20th of that month, were reviewed on the
24th by his Majesty, near Corbais. The summer
was passed by the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> in manœuvring,
patrolling, and skirmishing on the plains of Brabant,
and in performing out-post duty; and, returning
to Flanders in the autumn, they once more
occupied quarters at Ghent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1697</div>

<p>The regiment left Flanders in the early part of
May, 1697, and, having passed the Scheldt at
Dendermond, joined the army encamped at St.
Quintin Linneck on the 16th of that month. It
took part in the manœuvres of this campaign, and,
after several marches, was encamped a short time
before Brussels, from whence it was detached, for
the convenience of forage, to Wavre; and while at
this station hostilities were terminated by the
peace of Ryswick, when it was ordered to return
to England.</p>

<p>From Wavre the regiment marched to Flanders,
from whence it embarked for England, where it
arrived in December, and was ordered to march
into quarters in Staffordshire; at the same time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the establishment was reduced from fifty to thirty-one
private men per troop.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1698<br />1700<br />1701<br />1702</div>

<p>During the summer of 1698 it was occupying
quarters at Uttoxeter and Penxridge; and in
August, of the same year, it was reviewed by the
Duke of Schomberg at Lichfield. It remained in
Staffordshire until the month of June, 1700, when
it proceeded to the vicinity of London, and was
reviewed by his Majesty on Hounslow Heath;
and in November of the following year, furnished
a relay of escorts to attend the King from Margate
to London, when his Majesty returned from the
continent. It was subsequently stationed in the
vicinity of London, and in the beginning of 1702
received orders to hold itself in readiness for
foreign service: at the same time the establishment
was again augmented to fifty men per
troop.</p>

<p>The accession of the Duke of Anjou (grandson
of Louis XIV.) to the throne of Spain, in violation
of recent treaties, had re-kindled the flame of
war in Europe, and King William once more
united with the continental states to reduce the
exorbitant power of France. In the mean time
the Kings of France and Spain proclaimed the
Pretender King of Great Britain, by the title of
James III. This proceeding made the nation
sensible of the latent designs of France; the preparations
for war were expedited; and in the
beginning of March, 1702, the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>
embarked at Blackwall and Deptford. But the
death of King William occurring (8th of March)
before the transports sailed, the regiment was
ordered to disembark and march into quarters in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the villages near London. Queen Anne, however,
continued the course of policy adopted by her
predecessor, and on the 11th of March the regiment
was ordered to re-embark and proceed to
Holland, where it arrived towards the end of the
same month, and went into cantonments near
Breda.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>, with three other regiments
of British cavalry and two of infantry,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> were
stationed near Breda, until the 21st of June, when
they marched under the orders of Lieut.-General
Lumley to join the army. The French attempted
to intercept these regiments; but by forced marches
they eluded the enemy, and arrived at the camp
near Duckenburg, towards the end of the same
month.</p>

<p>The French, having obtained possession of the
Spanish Netherlands, the campaign commenced
on the Dutch frontiers. The <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>,
forming part of the army commanded by the Earl
of Marlborough, advanced against the immense
force of the enemy under the Duke of Burgundy
and Marshal Boufflers. Having crossed the
Maese near Grave, the British troops were engaged
in several daring and skilful manœuvres in
North Brabant and the province of Limburg, by
which the designs of the enemy were frustrated.</p>

<p>When the allies besieged <em>Venloo</em>, the <em>Fourth
Horse</em> were with the troops employed in observing
the enemy, and in protecting the supplies of forage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
provision, and ammunition: they were also similarly
engaged during the sieges of <em>Ruremonde</em> and
<em>Stevenswaert</em>.</p>

<p>These fortresses having been captured, the regiment
quitted its camp at Soutendael about midnight,
on the 10th of October, and, having crossed
the little river Jaar, advanced with the army towards
the city of <em>Liege</em>, where it arrived about
three in the following morning, when the suburb
of St. Walburg was found in flames, the French
having, upon the sudden advance of the allies,
attempted the destruction of the suburbs by fire,
and afterwards retired into the citadel, and into a
detached fortress called the <em>Chartreuse</em>.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> marched into the city of
Liege on the 14th of October, where they remained
until the 25th, when they were detached across
the river to invest the <em>Chartreuse</em>; and, after the
surrender of this place, they were employed in
escorting the garrison towards Antwerp.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Having
performed this service they went into village cantonments,
and before the following spring the
British commander was advanced to the dignity of
<span class="smcap">Duke</span> of Marlborough.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1703</div>

<p>Having passed the winter in Dutch Brabant,
the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>, moving from their quarters
in May, 1703, traversed the country to the vicinity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
of Maestricht; at the same time one division of
the army besieged and took <em>Bonn</em>. They were
subsequently encamped near the banks of the
Maese, where the Duke of Marlborough assembled
the army; and on the 24th of May advanced
against the enemy, who occupied an advantageous
post near Tongres; but on the approach of the
allies the French retired, and afterwards took
post behind their fortified lines.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> were subsequently encamped
with the army near <em>Haneff</em>, where they
were engaged in a slight skirmish with a detachment
of the enemy. The Duke of Marlborough
was desirous of attacking the French lines, but
was prevented by the indecision of the Dutch generals
and field-deputies. The <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>
were also employed in the operations which preceded
the investiture of <em>Huy</em>, and formed part of
the covering army during the siege of that place.
They were afterwards in the lines of circumvallation
before <em>Limburg</em>; and after the surrender of
this place they proceeded to Liege; and on the
4th of October joined the camp at St. Trond,
where they halted a few days, and were subsequently
distributed into cantonments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1704</div>

<p>The British horse again passed the winter
amongst the rude peasantry of Holland, and assembled
with the army in the spring of 1704 near
Ruremonde, from whence they directed their
march to Cologne, and afterwards proceeded
through a delightful country to Coblentz, a town
situate at the conflux of the Rhine and Moselle.
By these movements the Duke of Marlborough
indicated a design of carrying on the war in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
direction of the Moselle; but he had a more noble
and hazardous object in view.</p>

<p>The Elector of Bavaria, who is presumed to
have aspired to the imperial dignity, had commenced
hostilities against the Emperor of Germany.
In 1703, 30,000 French troops marched
through the Black Forest to assist him, the united
French and Bavarian armies were carrying all
before them, and it was apprehended that if
something extraordinary was not undertaken, the
Elector of Bavaria would gain the imperial throne,&mdash;Germany
would be subjected to French domination,&mdash;and
Louis XIV. would dictate laws to
Europe. To avert this disaster, the Duke of Marlborough
resolved to march the army under his
command from the Netherlands into the heart of
Germany.</p>

<p>In pursuance of this object, the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>,
having crossed the Rhine and the Moselle, moved
forward with the other cavalry regiments in advance
of the main army, and commenced their
march on an expedition which produced the most
stupendous results. During the advance the
regiments invariably moved from their camp ground
at the first dawn of morning light, completed
the march before the heat became oppressive,
and passed the remainder of the day in repose, or
in preparing for the succeeding day's march.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Continuing their route, under favourable circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
and in excellent order, the British
cavalry arrived towards the end of May at the
suburbs of Mentz, in the west of Germany,
where they halted a day to rest their horses.
From this place they advanced in four days to
Ladenburg, in the margraviate of Baden, and
having passed the Neckar, halted one day at their
camp beyond the town. From thence they directed
their march towards the Danube; while the nations
of Europe gazed with astonishment at this splendid
enterprise, and the different states through
which the troops passed hailed their arrival with
acclamations. At length a junction was effected
between the army of the Duke of Marlborough
and the forces of the German empire, and the
united troops co-operated in offensive measures.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>, having thus marched from
the ocean to the Danube, took an active part in
the operations which succeeded; and they formed
part of the forces which advanced at three o'clock
on the morning of the 2nd of July, and after traversing
many miles of difficult country, arrived in
front of the enemy's entrenched position on the
heights of <em>Schellenberg</em>, and commenced the attack
about six in the evening.</p>

<p>The infantry having advanced in the face of a
storm of fire from the enemy's batteries, and commenced
the assault, were forced to give way, when
the French and Bavarians, issuing from their
works, charged the broken ranks, but were driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
back. The attack was renewed with similar results.
The infantry, reduced in numbers and
exhausted by repeated struggles, were giving way,
when Lieutenant-General Lumley led the English
horse to their aid, and prevented a repulse. The
infantry renewed the attack, and eventually the
enemy was driven from the works. At this moment
the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> and other cavalry gallopping
forward, by a furious charge completed
the victory.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> The broken battalions and squadrons
fled in confusion, pursued by the victorious
British and German horsemen, who intercepted
the fugitives on every side, and the carnage which
followed was dreadful. Many of the French and
Bavarians were intercepted on the way to Donawerth,
others hurrying to the bridge of boats broke
it down by their weight and perished in the river.
Their commander, Count D'Arco, escaped with
difficulty. Sixteen pieces of cannon, thirteen colours,
all the tents, equipages, and a quantity of
plate, fell into the hands of the victors. The loss
of the regiment was not great;&mdash;Adjutant Skelton
and several men and horses were killed, and
others wounded; and its Colonel, Major-General
Wood, was also wounded.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>This brilliant success was followed by other
offensive operations, in which the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>
took part; but they were not engaged in executing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>that cruel order, in obedience to which the unfortunate
country of Bavaria was enveloped in flames,
and above 300 towns, villages, and hamlets were
destroyed: this relentless severity was the work
of the Germans.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> At length another reinforcement
of French troops arrived, and the united
French and Bavarians took post in the valley of
the Danube, near the village of <em>Blenheim</em>.</p>

<p>About three o'clock on the morning of the 13th
of August the allied army advanced, and after
traversing several miles of rugged ground, and
overcoming many local difficulties, arrived in presence
of the enemy; and the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>,
forming part of the cavalry of the left wing under
Major-General Wood, had their post in the first
line; the right wing being composed of Germans
under Prince Eugene of Savoy. About noon the
troops, advancing across the little river Nebel, by
bridges prepared for the occasion, commenced the
engagement, and a succession of attacks were
made and resisted with great bravery on both
sides. The <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>, with the other English
cavalry regiments, were engaged in the early
part of the action<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> with the household troops of
France, and the superior spirit and power of the
British horsemen were conspicuous, particularly in
the unconquerable resolution with which they
renewed the attack after a temporary repulse; yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>the palm of victory was nobly contested, and the
combatants fought hand to hand until the plain
was covered with dead. After successive efforts
made by the adverse armies&mdash;the one to advance,
and the other to maintain its ground&mdash;the protracted
contest drew to a crisis, and the French
infantry began to shrink before the tempest of
balls which thinned their ranks, while their cavalry,
broken and dispirited, gave way, when nine battalions
were cut to pieces or made prisoners. The
enemy attempted to restore the battle, but the
allied horse, once more rushing forward with
tremendous force, decided the fate of the day. The
enemy, after an irregular fire, fled in dismay, and
the regiment which forms the subject of this memoir,
after distinguishing itself in the charge,
pursued the French squadrons with terrible clamour
and confusion in the direction of Sonderheim,
smiting them to the ground, and chasing
them down the declivity near <em>Blenheim</em> into the
Danube, where numbers were drowned. At the
same time their commander-in-chief, Marshal
Tallard, and several other officers and many men,
were made prisoners.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>While this regiment was pursuing the French
horsemen towards the Danube, another part of the
army surrounded the village of <em>Blenheim</em>, where
twelve squadrons of dragoons and twenty-four battalions
of infantry were forced to surrender themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
prisoners of war. At the same time the
Germans on the right, under Prince Eugene, were
also triumphant. Thus a victory was achieved
which shed lustre on the British arms, and the
record of these events forms a page in history of
which every Englishman may be justly proud,
particularly the corps whose valour delivered the
empire from impending ruin, and whose fame resounded
throughout Christendom.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> had Lieutenant-Colonel
Fetherstonhalgh and Cornet Ordairne killed; also
Captain Armstrong, Captain Shute, Lieutenant
Dove, Cornet Forester, and Cornet Stevenson,
wounded. Of the private men killed and wounded
no return appears to have been preserved; but in
the War-Office books the regiment is stated to
have had forty-seven horses killed in this action.</p>

<p>Having passed the night after the battle on the
field, the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> followed for several
days the rear of the defeated army, which repassed
the Black Forest, and retired across the Rhine.
On the 6th of September the regiment was at
Kirlach; it passed the Rhine on the same day to
attack some squadrons which appeared on the
rising ground near Philipsburg; but, on the advance
of the English horsemen, the French retreated
across the Queich, and made preparations
to defend the passage of that river: they, however,
quitted their ground on the advance of the allies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
on the 9th of that month, on which day the
<span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> forded the stream, and were
afterwards encamped on the banks of the little
river Lauter, forming part of the covering army
during the siege of <em>Landau</em>, a strong town situated
in the beautiful valley near the Queich. After
the surrender of <em>Landau</em>, which terminated this
splendid and memorable campaign, the regiment
commenced its march back to Holland, while the
infantry sailed down the Rhine in boats to
Nimeguen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1705</div>

<p>The winter was again passed amongst the Dutch
villagers; and in April 1705 the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>
quitted their cantonments, and marching to the
vicinity of Maestricht, erected their tents in the
early part of May on the banks of the Maese, near
Viset, where they were reviewed by the Duke of
Marlborough on the 14th of that month. Leaving
this place on the following day, they marched in
the direction of Coblentz, and from thence through
a wild and mountainous country to Treves, and
were encamped beyond that city on the 26th of
May. After crossing the Moselle and the Saar,
on the 3rd of June they passed through the difficult
defiles of Tavernen and Onsdorf, following the
course of the Roman causeway over the heights,
then emerging into the more open ground towards
Tettingen, continued their route to the vicinity of
Syrk, where they passed the night under arms;
and on the following day encamped on the open
grounds near Elft; at the same time the enemy
occupied a strong position a few miles in advance.
The Duke of Marlborough was desirous of carrying
on the war in this direction, and the German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Princes had agreed to co-operate with his grace;
but their arrival was so long delayed that his
designs were frustrated, and as the French were
making rapid progress in the Netherlands, he was
induced to quit his position and march to the assistance
of the Dutch.</p>

<p>Accordingly, a little before midnight on the 17th
of June, during a heavy rain, the army struck its
tents, and the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>, composing part
of twenty squadrons destined to cover the movement,
formed up to confront the enemy, while the
army commenced the retreat, which was continued
throughout the night without interruption
from the French, and it re-crossed the Saar and the
Moselle on the following day. On the 19th the
retreat was resumed, and on the 25th the <span class="smcap">Fourth
Horse</span> and other cavalry arrived at Duren, in the
duchy of Juliers. At the same time the French
troops, near the Dutch frontiers, ceased acting on
the offensive, and retired in a panic to Tongres.</p>

<p>After this long and difficult march, the <span class="smcap">Fourth
Horse</span> crossed the Maese near Viset, and were
subsequently employed in covering the siege of
<em>Huy</em>, which the enemy had retaken during the
absence of the army up the Moselle.</p>

<p>The French army having taken refuge behind
their fortified lines, the Duke of Marlborough,
after the surrender of <em>Huy</em>, resolved to attempt to
surprise them in their formidable barrier, the construction
of which had employed the space of three
years. He accordingly, by a skilful manœuvre,
succeeded in dividing their forces and in drawing
them from the point selected for the attack. About
eleven o'clock on the evening of the 17th of July<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>, forming part of the division
destined to force the lines, left their camp ground
and continued their march throughout an extremely
dark night, until about four the next
morning, when the heads of columns approached
the works at <em>Neer-Hespen</em> and <em>Helexim</em>. The
guards were surprised and fled in a panic, the
lines were forced and partly levelled, and the British
horse were soon within the barriers; but
before the regiments were formed, the Marquis
d'Allegre appeared with fifty squadrons of cavalry
and twenty battalions of infantry, and opened a
cannonade from eight pieces of artillery. After
the allied infantry had fired a few rounds, the
Duke of Marlborough led forward the cavalry,
which had passed the works, and the gallant
British horsemen, by an impetuous charge, broke
the enemy's ranks. The victorious squadrons
afterwards sustained some loss from the fire of
the enemy's infantry, but a second charge decided
the combat; the hostile cavalry were routed and
dispersed, several battalions of infantry were cut
to pieces, many prisoners, standards, and colours
were taken, and the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> were once
more triumphant over the legions of France and
Spain.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>After this brilliant success the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>
were engaged in several manœuvres, and marches
along the fruitful plains of the Netherlands; but
the opposition which the British commander met
with from the Dutch generals proved detrimental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
to the future operations of this campaign. In
the autumn the regiment was with the covering
army during the siege of <em>Sandvliet</em>, and after
the surrender of this place, marched back to Holland,
where it was joined by a remount of men and
horses from England.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1706</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>, with the other four English
cavalry regiments on the continent, were now
become a celebrated body of troops; and in April,
1706, when they again took the field, it is recorded
that the officers and men looked forward with joyful
anticipations to the events of another campaign.
After traversing the province of Limburg, they
joined the army at Bilsen, in the bishopric of
Liege, on the 20th of May, and immediately afterwards
advanced against the enemy.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 23rd of May the army
was proceeding towards the Mehaine, and as the
advance-guard, of which a detachment of the
<span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> formed a part, arrived at the uplands
near Mierdorp, the enemy were seen traversing
the plain near Mont St. André, their right
stretching beyond the village of <em>Ramilies</em> towards
the Mehaine; and their magnificent army, composed
of French, Spaniards, and Bavarians, commanded
by the Elector of Bavaria and Marshal
Villeroy, was soon formed in order of battle. At
the same time the allies made preparations for
commencing the action, and the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>
took their station in the right wing of the army.
About half-past one the battle commenced; but
the British horsemen were kept in reserve until a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
decisive moment should arrive, when their well-known
spirit and physical power would, it was
expected, produce important results. The battle
had lasted nearly three hours, when the Duke of
Marlborough seized a critical moment to strike a
decisive blow, and the British cavalry was brought
forward. The <em>Fourth</em> and Seventh Horse, commanded
by Major-General Wood, passed the little
river Geete, and dashed along the plain on the
right of the village of <em>Ramilies</em>, overthrowing all
opposition, until they arrived at the rising ground
behind the village of Offuz. The enemy was now
in full retreat, and the two regiments went sweeping
along the plain in pursuit until they arrived
at the farm of Chantrain, where they overtook the
Spanish and Bavarian Horse Guards, who, with
the Elector and Marshal Villeroy at their head,
were endeavouring to cover the retreat of their
artillery. Having gained the enemy's left flank,
the foaming squadrons of the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>
rushed upon the Spaniards and Bavarians, and,
with one tremendous shock, broke their ranks in
pieces! Then commenced the clash of swords,
with all the uproar, strife, and turmoil of a close
combat, while the Spaniards and Bavarians fell in
numbers before the superior prowess of the victors;
and the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> took many prisoners,
with the <span class="smcap">Standard<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> and Kettle-Drums of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Bavarian Guards</span>, and the Elector and Marshal
Villeroy narrowly escaped.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>After this noble exploit the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>,
having detached a party to the rear with the prisoners
and cannon, continued the pursuit throughout
the night until two o'clock of the following
morning, making additional captures of men, artillery,
and ammunition waggons, until the troopers
and their horses were exhausted with the extraordinary
exertions and fatigues they had undergone.
Thus was one of the best-appointed and most
gallant armies which France ever brought into
the field nearly destroyed, and the reputation of
the British troops and their distinguished leader
exalted; while the result of the victory was the
deliverance from the power of the enemy of an
extent of territory exceeding the most sanguine
expectation.</p>

<p>After a few days' repose the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>
were detached with other troops to summon several
towns and fortresses in the Spanish Netherlands;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
many places surrendered immediately, and
renounced their allegiance to the Duke of Anjou;
other towns, overawed by French garrisons, stood
short sieges, but were captured before the end of
the campaign, when the regiment went into quarters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1707</div>

<p>Early in the spring of 1707 the losses of the
<span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> during the preceding campaign
were replaced by a remount of 60 men and 94
horses from England;<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> at the same time the regiment
was again supplied with <span class="smcap">Armour</span>,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and
when it took the field it once more appeared as a
corps of <span class="smcap">Cuirassiers</span>. In the early part of the
campaign it was encamped on the banks of the
little river Sienne, and subsequently near Meldert.
It was employed in several manœuvres designed
to bring on a general engagement, which the
French cautiously avoided. They ventured, for a
short time, to encamp in front of the fortified lines
which had served for a defence to their frontiers
during the preceding war; but they made a precipitate
retreat upon the advance of the allies, who
continued in the field until the autumn, when
they separated into quarters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1708</div>

<p>The winter having been passed by the <span class="smcap">Fourth
Horse</span> amongst the hardy Belgians, they left
Flanders in May, 1708, and proceeding to the
vicinity of Brussels were formed in brigade with
the Duke of Schomberg's regiment (now Seventh
Dragoon Guards), commanded by Brigadier-General
Sybourg. They were afterwards engaged
in several operations in Brabant and Hainault;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>while the enemy, taking advantage of the absence
of the troops from Ghent and Bruges, obtained
possession, by treachery, of these two towns, which
had been the winter quarters of the English
forces.</p>

<p>A series of movements at length brought on
the battle of <em>Oudenarde</em>, which was fought on the
11th of July in the inclosures near the banks of
the Scheldt.</p>

<p>During the early part of the action the five<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
regiments of <span class="smcap">British Cuirassiers</span>, having crossed
the Scheldt by the bridge of boats, were stationed
in reserve on the plain of Huerne, behind the
right wing of the army, ready to charge when the
moment for a decisive attack of the horse should
arrive. Advancing from this post they supported
the infantry engaged, manœuvring so as to sustain
the line in front, and to be ever ready to execute
a charge, while their presence held in check several
French corps; but owing to the local peculiarities
of the ground, which was intersected by
hedges, ditches, and rivulets, darkness put an end
to the conflict before these warlike horsemen, who
panted for an opportunity once more to distinguish
themselves, were called upon to engage in close
combat. The French retreated in confusion during
the night, and at daybreak the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>,
with several other corps, were detached in pursuit;
some slight skirmishing occurred, and the French
took refuge under the cannon of Ghent.</p>

<p>In the movements which followed this victory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> took part, and they were subsequently
employed in protecting the battering
cannon, with an immense convoy of military stores,
which were sent from Brussels to the army. They
also formed part of the covering army during the
siege of <em>Lisle</em>, an important and formidable fortress,
protected by a Marshal of France, Boufflers,
with a garrison of 15,000 men, and everything
requisite for a successful defence; at the same
time Louis XIV. commanded an immense army
to be assembled for the purpose of raising the
siege. But the allies, unmoved by the menacing
manœuvres and threatened attacks of the enemy,
prosecuted their purpose with vigour, and the
vaunts of the French commanders evaporated in a
short cannonade which produced little result.</p>

<p>The supplies of ammunition and provision for
the besieging army having to be conveyed a considerable
distance by land, the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>
were occasionally detached from the army to guard
the waggons and cover their advance. In September
an immense convoy, with ammunition and
other necessaries, was despatched from Ostend
under the charge of a guard commanded by Major-General
Webb; at the same time the Count de
La Motte advanced with 22,000 French troops to
intercept this supply, on the safe arrival of which
the fate of <em>Lisle</em> depended; and the <span class="smcap">Fourth
Horse</span>, with several other corps, were detached
from the camp at Lannoy under Major-General
Cadogan to the aid of the convoy. As the British
squadrons approached the woods of <em>Wynendale</em>, a
loud cannonade was heard; they instantly dashed
forward, and the moment they arrived at the scene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
of conflict the French relinquished the attack, and
the stores were conveyed in safety to the camp.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>After the surrender of <em>Lisle</em>, the <span class="smcap">Fourth
Horse</span> marched to East Flanders, and were engaged
in military operations until <em>Ghent</em> and
<em>Bruges</em> were re-captured, when the regiment went
into quarters; and the losses of the preceding
campaign were replaced by a remount of ninety-seven
men and seventy-one horses.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1709</div>

<p>After remaining in quarters in Flanders until
June, 1709, the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> advanced up the
country and erected their tents on the plain of
Lisle, near the banks of the Deule, where a vast
and magnificent army, composed of the troops of
several nations, extended its encampment in regular
order over a large tract of country, and exhibited
a fine spectacle of war. From this camp
the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> proceeded to the banks of
the Scheldt, and formed part of the covering army
during the siege of the boasted impregnable fortress
of <em>Tournay</em>, which surrendered in the beginning
of September.</p>

<p>From the banks of the Scheldt the <span class="smcap">Fourth
Horse</span> moved with the army in the direction of
<em>Mons</em>, the capital of the province of Hainault,
with the design of wresting this important place
from the power of France. But while the allies
were on the march, the French army moved from
its former post and took up a position near <em>Malplaquet</em>,
at the same time increasing the natural
strength of the post by entrenchments and other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>works. In this camp were collected the choicest
troops of France, commanded by two celebrated
Marshals, Villiers and Boufflers, and opposed to
them the victorious Marlborough and Eugene
headed the heroes of Blenheim and Ramilies,
amongst whom were the celebrated British Horse
under the chivalrous Lieut.-General Wood.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 11th of September (N.
S.), after divine service had been performed at the
head of the troops, the battle commenced with an
animation and effect which indicated the ardour
that prevailed in both armies. In the attack of
the entrenchments, and in forcing the works, the
cavalry could not take part, and for a time the
services of the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> were limited to
supporting the attack on the left centre, where
the enemy's position was eventually forced by the
infantry. In the midst of the arduous struggle,
and while the storm of war was raging with
dreadful fury, the Duke of Marlborough led forward
the five regiments of <span class="smcap">British Cuirassiers</span>,
commanded by Lieut.-General Wood, and the
Prussian cavalry, against the renowned Gens
d'armes of France, who were instantly routed
and chased from the ground; but as the British
and Prussian horsemen, who were somewhat
broken by the charge, continued their victorious
course and swept the field in triumph, they were
met by a compact line of French cavalry, consisting
of the Gardes-du-Corps, Light Horse, Musqueteers,
and Horse Grenadiers of the royal
household, led by Marshal Boufflers, and these
distinguished troops succeeded in driving back
the squadrons of the allies. The British horse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>men
were, however, only repulsed, not defeated:
they soon rallied again, and, glowing with zeal to
encounter so celebrated an enemy, they returned
to the charge, when their valour and prowess prevailed;
and the French squadrons being driven
from the field, the remainder of their army retired
immediately afterwards, leaving the allies victorious,
but with the loss of many men killed and
wounded, and the pursuit was not continued beyond
the village of Quievrain.</p>

<p>Thus ended a day in which the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>
acquired new honours. They were subsequently
with the covering army during the siege of <em>Mons</em>,
and after its surrender marched to East Flanders
for winter quarters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1710</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>, having been completed
by another remount from England,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> marched out
of their quarters in the beginning of April, 1710,
and advanced to the banks of the Scheldt near
Tournay, where the allied army, consisting of the
troops of several nations, was assembled, and, according
to the journals of that period, the <span class="smcap">British
Cuirassiers</span> made a noble appearance.</p>

<p>From this camp the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> advanced
at five o'clock in the afternoon of the 20th of
April, and formed part of the column under
Lieut.-General Cadogan, which, after marching
all night, surprised the French guard at <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pont à
Vendin</i>, and penetrated their fortified lines without
opposition.</p>

<p>The siege of <em>Douay</em>, a strong town situate on
the river Scarpe, was afterwards undertaken, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>, forming part of the covering
army, were engaged in several manœuvres and
marches to counteract the operations of the enemy,
who menaced the besieging force with an attack;
but the superior tactics of the Duke of Marlborough
and Prince Eugene, with the bravery of
their troops, prevailed, and <em>Douay</em> was surrendered
on the 27th of June. After repairing the
works, the army advanced towards the enemy,
who, to avoid an engagement, retired behind their
new lines of defence, when the allies directed
their victorious arms against <em>Bethune</em>, and the
<span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> had their post in the besieging
force until the surrender of the place on the 29th
of August. They were subsequently employed
in covering the sieges of <em>Aire</em> and <em>St. Venant</em>,
and after the termination of this successful campaign
returned to Flanders, where they passed the
winter in convenient quarters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1711</div>

<p>Advancing from thence in April, 1711, they
directed their march to the banks of the Scarpe,
and were subsequently employed in several manœuvres
before the French lines of defence until
the enemy's troops were drawn to the left, when
the Duke of Marlborough, by secretly assembling
a body of troops at Douay, forced the lines at
<em>Arleux</em> and invested <em>Bouchain</em>. The siege of this
place was one of the most difficult enterprises
undertaken during the war, and the <span class="smcap">Fourth
Horse</span> were fully employed in the multifarious
services required, the lines extending for many
miles, and the greatest care and vigilance being
necessary. In September the place surrendered,
and this regiment, after traversing the recently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
conquered territory, to its former winter station,
went into cantonments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1712</div>

<p>It again took the field with the army in the
spring of 1712, and advancing to the frontiers,
was prepared to enter France; when the Duke
of Ormond, who now commanded the British
troops on the continent, received orders to cease
hostilities, as negotiations for a general peace had
commenced. In the mean time the regiment had
lost its Colonel, the distinguished and spirited cavalry
officer Lieutenant-General Cornelius Wood,
whose death was occasioned by the fall of his
horse; and he was succeeded in the command of
the regiment by Thomas Viscount Windsor, from
the Tenth Horse, by commission, dated the 18th
of May, 1712.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1713<br />1714</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> marched with the British
forces from the French territory, and were encamped
a short time in the vicinity of Ghent.
They subsequently went into quarters, and these
distinguished horsemen, after remaining on the
continent until the treaty of Utrecht had given
peace to Europe, were embarked for England,
landed at the Red House near London in the beginning
of April 1714, and having returned their
<span class="smcap">Cuirasses</span> into store, proceeded to Northampton,
Daventry, and Wellingborough. In the mean-time
the establishment was reduced from 400 to
226 officers and soldiers.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>On the decease of Queen Anne, in August of
the same year, the regiment marched into quarters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>near the metropolis, where it remained until the
arrival of His Majesty King George I. from Hanover,
and afterwards proceeded to Gloucester
and Tewkesbury. In October a squadron marched
to Margate, and the remainder of the regiment
was posted in detachments of two officers and
twenty men each, between that place and London,
to attend the Princess of Wales on her arrival.
Her Royal Highness with the Princesses Anne
and Amelia landed at Margate on the evening of
the 11th of October, when they were received by
a guard of the regiment, and on the following
day they were escorted to Dorchester, where they
were met by the Prince of Wales and the Dukes of
Somerset and Argyle and the Earl of Bridgewater,
and were conducted to the metropolis by the
<span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> on the 13th of October.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1715<br />1716</div>

<p>The peaceful accession of His Majesty was followed
by the most strenuous exertions of many of
the partisans of the Pretender; and in 1715 they
broke out into open rebellion under the Earl of
Mar. The army was immediately augmented,
and ten men per troop were added to the establishment
of the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>. Upon notice of a
meditated rise at Bath, this regiment, with Sir
Robert Rich's Dragoons, took possession of that
city, where they seized a great quantity of arms.
England was at this period in great danger from
the prevalence of jacobite principles, and the animosity
with which two powerful parties in the
state were arrayed against each other gave occasion
for much alarm; but the staunch fidelity of
the army overawed the disaffected, and the gallant
troops who had so recently conquered the foes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Britain abroad, preserved the nation from the machinations
of its enemies at home. The army,
though on a reduced establishment, was in excellent
condition, and the cavalry in particular was
considered the best mounted of any troops in
Europe.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1717</div>

<p>After the suppression of this rebellion the King
of Sweden espoused the cause of the Pretender,
and made preparations for a descent upon Britain;
and the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>, with several other corps,
were placed under the command of Lieutenant-General
Wills, and sent to the north. This regiment
was quartered a short time at Newcastle-upon-Tyne,
and the Colonelcy was given to Lieutenant-General
George Wade, who had distinguished
himself in the war in Spain, by commission
dated the 19th of March, 1717.</p>

<p>The project of Sweden having been defeated by
the exertions of the British fleet, the regiment
returned to the south of England, and took the
travelling escort-duty for the Royal Family: at
the same time the establishment was reduced to
twenty-five private men per troop.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1718<br />1719</div>

<p>In 1718 the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> were quartered
at Nottingham and Northampton; and in November
1719 they were stationed on the Essex road,
to attend His Majesty from Harwich to London,
on his return from Hanover.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1720<br />1722</div>

<p>In the following year they occupied dispersed
cantonments in Oxfordshire; in 1721 they were
quartered at Dorchester and Salisbury; and in
the summer of 1722 encamped near Andover, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
afterwards on Salisbury Plain, where they were
reviewed, with three other regiments of cavalry and
seven of infantry, by His Majesty and the Prince
of Wales, on the 30th of August. The camp was
broken up in the beginning of October, when
this regiment marched to Warwick and Coventry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1724<br />1725<br />1726</div>

<p>During the summer of 1724 the <span class="smcap">Fourth
Horse</span> occupied quarters near London, and again
performed the travelling escort-duty. They also
furnished a party in constant attendance on the
Prince and Princess of Wales. In the following
year they occupied quarters at Stamford, Huntingdon,
and Peterborough; and in 1726 at Warwick
and Coventry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1727<br />1728</div>

<p>On the accession of King George II., in 1727,
the regiment marched to the vicinity of London,
was reviewed by His Majesty in September of the
same year, and was afterwards in attendance on
the court until May 1728, when it returned to its
former quarters at Coventry and Warwick.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1731<br />1732<br />1733<br />1734<br />1737</div>

<p>In January 1731 it was again on the King's
duty, and was reviewed by His Majesty on Hounslow
Heath in May of the same year. The two
succeeding years were passed in country quarters,
and in May 1734 it resumed its attendance
on the Court. On the 29th of June following
His Majesty reviewed the corps of Life Guards,
when this regiment had the honour of furnishing
the royal escort required on the occasion. In November
of the same year, having been relieved on
the King's duty by the Royal Horse Guards, it
marched to Nottingham and Derby, where it remained
until April 1737, when it resumed its
station at Coventry and Warwick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1738</div>

<p>On the 5th of July, 1738, the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>,
and the Royal regiment of Horse Guards, were reviewed
by His Majesty on Hounslow Heath, and
their appearance and discipline were approved of
by the King.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1740<br />1741</div>

<p>After the review the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> marched
into quarters in Staffordshire. During the summer
of 1740 they were encamped near Newbury;
and in 1741 formed part of a body of troops encamped
on Lexdon Heath, near Colchester.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1742<br />1743</div>

<p>Towards the close of the summer of 1742 a
British army proceeded to Flanders, to make a
diversion in favour of the Queen of Hungary,
whose dominions were overrun by the armies of
France and Bavaria; but the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>
remained in England, and in the beginning of
May, 1743, they marched into quarters near the
metropolis, and resumed their duties of attendance
on the Court. On the 17th of the same month
one squadron was sent in pursuit of a number of
deserters from Lord Semphill's (42nd) Highland
regiment, a corps formed in 1739 of independent
companies of infantry, raised in the Highlands,
for service in the mountain districts during the
disaffection which prevailed for some years in the
north of Scotland.</p>

<p>The Highland regiment was designed for foreign
service. In pursuance of this object it marched
to the south of England, and on the 14th of May<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
was reviewed by General Wade on Finchley
Common, when the novelty of the scene attracted
thousands of spectators to view the unique costume
of the corps, and its appearance and discipline
were generally admired. After the review the
Highlanders were ordered to Gravesend, to embark
for Flanders, but, as many of the men had enlisted
on the presumption that they would never be required
to quit the kingdom, and a report being
spread amongst them that they were designed for
the West Indies, a country which, at this period,
was considered as a charnel-house for Europeans,
about 150 of them deserted with their arms, and
proceeded in a body towards Scotland.</p>

<p>The squadron of the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> sent in
pursuit of the Highlanders overtook them in
Northamptonshire; and on Sunday, the 22nd of
May, surrounded them in Lady-wood, near
Oundle, and shortly afterwards the horse were
joined by a squadron of Churchill's Dragoons
(now Tenth Hussars). The Highlanders were
disposed to submit on condition of receiving a <em>free
pardon</em>; at the same time they took possession of
a strong post in the wood, and, being provided
with ammunition, they declared their determination
to resist to the last extremity, and be cut to
pieces rather than submit on any other terms.
Captain Ball, of the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>, had an
interview with them, and, after trying every remonstrance
and persuasion in vain, he was obliged
to leave them. He, however, gained over two
of their number, who conducted him out of the
wood, and, promising them both a free pardon, he
induced one to return and endeavour to prevail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
upon the remainder to submit. Eventually the
main body surrendered at discretion, and were
conducted to the Tower of London, where three
of their number were tried and shot, and the
remainder were drafted to different colonies
abroad. This event did not, however, prevent
the embarkation of the Highland regiment for
Flanders.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1744<br />1745</div>

<p>In the beginning of 1744 the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>
were <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'ordered so send'">ordered to send</ins> a draft of sixty men and
horses to Flanders to be incorporated in the three
regiments of horse on foreign service. At the
same time several additional corps were sent to the
continent, but this regiment remained in the south
of England until September 1745, when it was
ordered to Nottingham; and on the receipt of information
of the arrival of Charles Edward, eldest
son of the Pretender, in Scotland, it marched to
Newcastle-upon-Tyne, where several corps were
assembled under the command of Field-Marshal
Wade. In the mean time the young Pretender
was joined by several Highland clans, and, there
being but few troops in Scotland to oppose his
progress, he gained possession of Edinburgh,
surprised and defeated several corps under Sir
John Cope at Preston Pans, and afterwards
penetrated into England. At the same time
Field-Marshal Wade marched with the troops
under his command, by Durham, Darlington, and
Richmond, in order to cover Yorkshire, and the
cavalry proceeded to Doncaster, where the <span class="smcap">Fourth
Horse</span> arrived on the 8th of December.</p>

<p>Information having been received of the advance
of the Highlanders to Derby, and of their preci<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>pitate
retreat from thence towards Scotland, an
attempt was made to intercept them, but without
success. The <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> were subsequently
despatched, with some other corps, under Major-General
Oglethorp, in pursuit, and, after marching
a distance of 100 miles in three days, in most inclement
weather, and along roads choked with ice
and snow, the King's troops overtook and defeated
the rear of the rebel army on the borders of Lancashire,
and captured several prisoners; but the
main body of the Highlanders escaped, and, having
placed a garrison in Carlisle, continued their
flight to Scotland. The <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> pursued
the Highlanders to Carlisle, and were stationed
near that city until its surrender on the
30th of December.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1746</div>

<p>In the beginning of 1746 the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>
marched to York, and, after the decisive overthrow
of the rebel army at <em>Culloden</em>, the regiment furnished
escorts to guard parties of prisoners to
Lincoln, and other places, in which service it was
partially engaged throughout the summer; and
in September it was stationed at Bristol.</p>

<p>The suppression of this rebellion having been
effected, His Majesty resolved, as a measure of
economy, to reduce this and two other regiments
from the pay and quality of <span class="smcap">Horse</span> to that of
<span class="smcap">Dragoons</span>. The establishment was accordingly
changed on the 25th of December, 1746, and, the
pay of the non-commissioned officers and private
men being reduced by this alteration, every man
received a gratuity of three pounds, with the option
of his discharge; and the men who accepted their
discharge received fourteen days' pay each, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
defray the expense of their journey home. The
regiment was now armed with long muskets and
bayonets, also with swords and pistols, as before.
A slight alteration was at the same time made in
the uniform;&mdash;the officers were distinguished by
gold lace and embroidery on their regimentals,
and a crimson silk sash worn over the left
shoulder; the quarter-masters by gold lace, and
silk sashes round their waists; and the serjeants
by narrow lace on the lappels, sleeves, and pockets,
and a worsted sash round the waist. When this
change had taken place His Majesty conferred on
the regiment the title of <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span>,
by a warrant dated the 9th of January, 1747, of
which the following is a copy:&mdash;</p>

<p>The regiment, having thus been constituted the
<span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span>, was disposed in quarters
at Leicester and Coventry, where it passed
that and the following summer, and in the autumn
of 1748 marched to Durham and Newcastle.</p>

<p>After the decease of Field-Marshal Wade, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
February, 1748, the Colonelcy was conferred on
the Honourable Charles Howard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1749<br />1750</div>

<p>In the succeeding year the regiment was stationed
at York and Barnard Castle; and in 1750
at Loughborough, Norwich, and North Yarmouth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1752<br />1753<br />1754</div>

<p>In the spring of 1752 the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon
Guards</span> furnished a relay of escorts to attend the
King to Harwich, where His Majesty embarked
for the continent, on a visit to his German dominions.
During the remainder of that year, and in
the two succeeding years, detachments of the regiment
were employed on coast duty in Suffolk,
Essex, and Devonshire. Owing to an increase of
duty on several articles of foreign produce, smuggling
had become prevalent to a great extent in
England, and it was found necessary to have parties
of dragoons constantly stationed in the maritime
towns and villages to assist the officers of the
revenue in preventing the introduction of contraband
goods. At the same time a laxity of morals
prevailed amongst the labouring classes; and, in
the absence of an efficient police in the kingdom,
parties of dragoons were employed to patrole the
public roads for the prevention of highway robberies,
which had become alarmingly frequent,
and were often attended with acts of cruelty and
even murder. From the ephemeral publications
of the day it appears that organized gangs of robbers
infested many parts of the kingdom at this
period.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1755</div>

<p>In 1755 signs of an approaching war began to
appear. The French committed several acts of
violence against British settlements in America;
retaliation was made by the English troops, and
the French were driven from the possessions they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
had seized. The British Court was disposed to an
amicable arrangement of the existing differences;
but such difficulties were raised by France, that
his Majesty deemed it prudent to augment the
strength of the regular army, and an addition of
1 corporal and 15 men was made to the strength
of each troop of the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span>:
and subsequently a <span class="fs80">LIGHT TROOP</span>, consisting of
3 officers, 1 quarter-master, 2 serjeants, 3 corporals,
2 drummers, and 60 private men, was
added to the establishment.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> The general utility
of light dragoons had been manifest in continental
warfare; a regiment of light horse raised
by the Duke of Kingston in 1744 had been
highly instrumental in the suppression of the rebellion
in Scotland; and from the autumn of 1755
light cavalry have constituted a portion of the
British land forces.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1756</div>

<p>The aggressions of France in America were followed
by a declaration of war; when the King of
France made preparations for a descent upon England,
which produced considerable alarm in the
kingdom; but the designs of the enemy were frustrated
by the warlike preparations of the British
Government. In this year (1756) the establishment
of the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span> was 24
officers, 7 quarter-masters, and 427 non-commissioned
officers and private men.</p>

<p>During the summer a detachment of the regiment
was stationed at Kensington to assist the
Life Guards in the performance of the travelling
escort-duty for the royal family.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1757</div>

<p>In July, 1757, the regiment was encamped, with
several other corps, on Salisbury Plain, under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
command of Lieut.-General Hawley; and a brigade
was there formed of the <span class="fs80">LIGHT TROOPS</span> of several
regiments, for instruction in the evolutions, and in
services peculiar to light cavalry. In autumn the
regiment marched to quarters at Colchester, Malden,
and Witham.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1758</div>

<p>The augmentation made in the naval and military
establishments of the kingdom enabled the British
Government to act offensively, and in the spring
of 1758 the <span class="fs80">LIGHT TROOP</span> of the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon
Guards</span> was called upon to hold itself in
readiness for actual warfare. In April it was
ordered to encamp near Petersfield, where a brigade
was formed of the light troops of nine regiments,
under the command of Colonel Eliott, of the Horse
Grenadier Guards. Towards the end of May the
brigade embarked on board transports,&mdash;forming
part of an expedition under Charles Duke of
Marlborough, designed for a descent on the coast
of France. On the 5th of June the Fleet arrived
in Cancalle Bay, on the coast of Brittany, and,
having silenced a battery on the shore, part of the
troops were immediately landed; when a battalion
of French infantry and two troops of cavalry,
posted on the heights near that place, retired without
making opposition. On the following day the
brigade of light cavalry and the artillery were
landed; and on the 7th the whole (excepting three
battalions of infantry left to cover the coast)
marched to the vicinity of <em>St. Maloes</em>, and during
the night the light cavalry, with detachments from
the infantry, set fire to the shipping and naval
stores at St. Servan, destroyed a fleet of privateers,
with a man-of-war of fifty guns, and another of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
thirty-six, and afterwards retired. The capture of
St. Maloes had been designed; but the expedition
was not provided with troops and heavy ordnance
sufficient for so great an undertaking; consequently
that design was laid aside, and on the 11th of June
the light cavalry were re-embarked. A second
descent being rendered impracticable by severe
weather, the fleet returned to England, and the
light cavalry landed and encamped near Portsmouth
and subsequently on Southsea Common.</p>

<p>A second visit to the coast of France was however
determined on; and after several experiments
had been made with flat-bottomed boats to ascertain
the practicability of landing troops in rough
weather, the <span class="fs80">LIGHT TROOP</span> of the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon
Guards</span> was again embarked, and the expedition
sailed on the 1st of August, under the command of
Lieut.-General Bligh. After seven days the fleet
anchored near <em>Cherbourg</em>; the troops landed,&mdash;the
town surrendered,&mdash;the fortifications and works of
the place with the shipping in the harbour were
destroyed, and the brass ordnance were brought
away as trophies of their success. A second descent
was afterwards made on the coast of Brittany;
but no advantage resulted from this enterprise;
and when the troops re-embarked, the rear-guard
was attacked by a considerable body of the enemy,
and about 1000 men, with many officers of distinction,
were killed, drowned, or taken prisoners.</p>

<p>In the mean time His Majesty's German dominions
had been the scene of conflict and disaster;
and a body of Hanoverian, Hessian, and Brunswick
troops, commanded by the Duke of Cumberland,
had been subject to a capitulation, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
which it was agreed that the Hessian and Brunswick
forces should return to their homes, and
the Hanoverians remain in a district assigned to
them: at the same time the Electorate of Hanover
was taken possession of by the enemy. The
conditions of this capitulation were, however, violated
by the French; the Hanoverians resumed
their arms, and, with the Hessian and Brunswick
troops, amounting to 30,000 men, all in British
pay, re-assembled under the command of Prince
Ferdinand Duke of Brunswick, and had the advantage
in several actions with the enemy. In
July a British force was ordered to proceed to
Germany, under the command of Charles, Duke
of Marlborough, and the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span>
were ordered for this service.</p>

<p>Previous to embarking they were encamped on
Blackheath, on a fine lawn in front of the residence
of Sir George Page, where they were reviewed by
His Majesty in presence of a vast concourse of spectators,
and their fine appearance was universally admired;
at the same time the most sanguine expectations
were entertained of the future achievements
of this distinguished corps on the field of battle.</p>

<p>On the 27th of July the regiment embarked at
Gravesend, and arrived at Embden, in Germany,
on the 1st of August. On the 3rd of that month
the troops landed a few miles above the town,
where they encamped until the morning of the
5th, when they commenced their march up the
country, and joined the army commanded by Prince
Ferdinand of Brunswick on the 17th. On the
20th the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span> were reviewed,
with several other corps, by his Serene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Highness, who expressed his admiration of their
condition after the march. They were not, however,
engaged in any affair of importance during
the remainder of the campaign; and they passed
the winter in quarters in the bishopric of Osnaburg.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1759</div>

<p>The allies commenced operations early in the
spring of 1759, and, having gained considerable
advantage over the enemy in the country of Hesse,
afterwards attacked (13th of April) the French
army commanded by the Duke of Broglio in its
position at <em>Bergen</em>. In this action the <span class="smcap">Third
Dragoon Guards</span> supported the attack of the
infantry, and were subsequently brought forward
to menace the enemy's front; but it was found impracticable
to force the position, and during the
following night the allies retired, nor were they
enabled to make a stand against the superior numbers
of the enemy for some time afterwards.</p>

<p>During this campaign the regiment was formed
in brigade with the Scots Greys and Tenth Dragoons:
and on the 17th of July it was encamped
on Petershagen Heath, a few miles from <em>Minden</em>,
and near the strong position occupied by the French
army under the Duke de Broglio and Marshal
Contades.</p>

<p>On the 29th of July the allies advanced and
took post at Hillé, and the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon
Guards</span> were encamped on the extreme right of
the cavalry. Prince Ferdinand having, by several
manœuvres, succeeded in drawing the French
army from its strong post in front of <em>Minden</em>, a
general engagement was fought on the 1st of
August, when the valour of the British infantry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
decided the fortune of the day, and the enemy,
after a sharp contest, sustained a decisive defeat,
with the loss of forty-three pieces of cannon, ten
pair of colours, and seven standards. At the
commencement of the action the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon
Guards</span> were posted, with several other corps,
under Lord George Sackville,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> behind a thick
wood on the right of the army, and, although
these troops were not brought forward in time to
share in the conflict and glories of the day, yet they
afterwards highly distinguished themselves in the
pursuit of the enemy a distance of about two
hundred miles, in which great difficulties were
overcome, and several French corps were nearly
annihilated.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span> took part in
the several manœuvres and skirmishes of this
campaign, which were continued throughout the
year. In November the regiment was posted on
the banks of the river Lahn, and it subsequently
occupied cantonments near Osnaburg.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1760</div>

<p>In the spring of 1760 the enemy brought into
the field an army of 100,000 men, commanded by
the Duke of Broglio, with a separate corps under
the Count de St. Germain; and so far outnumbered
the allies, that the latter were obliged to act
on the defensive. The <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span>
left their cantonments in the early part of May,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
arrived at Paderborn on the 12th, and on the 20th
encamped on the heights near Fritzlar, where they
were formed in brigade with the First and Second
Dragoon Guards, under the command of Major-General
Webb. The enemy, superior in numbers
and situation, advanced against the allies, some
skirmishing occurred, but Prince Ferdinand was
ultimately obliged to retire. Leaving Fritzlar on
the 24th of June, the allies proceeded in the
direction of the Dymel, and on the 9th of July the
main army took post on the heights of Brannau.
On the same day the First and <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon
Guards</span> were sent forward to Saxenhausen, to reinforce
a separate body of troops commanded by
the Hereditary Prince of Brunswick.</p>

<p>On the 10th of July the Hereditary Prince
marched towards <em>Corbach</em>, and when he approached
that place he discovered a body of French
troops formed upon the heights near the town.
Imagining it was only the advanced guard of the
Count de St. Germain's corps, his Highness determined
to endeavour to dislodge them. The attack
was accordingly made, and the intrepidity and
firmness of the troops were conspicuous; but the
enemy proved more numerous than was anticipated,
and, being reinforced with fresh troops, it
was found impossible to drive them from the
advantageous post which they occupied, and a
retreat was ordered. This was, however, rendered
of difficult execution by the pressure of the enemy's
advanced corps. Some disorder occurred. Several
German regiments of infantry and cavalry were
thrown into confusion, and the enemy, following
up this advantage with a large body of dragoons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
and a numerous artillery, threatened the entire
destruction of this portion of the allied army.
At this critical moment the First and <span class="smcap">Third
Dragoon Guards</span> were brought forward to undertake
a service of great magnitude,&mdash;no less than
to confront a torrent of superior and increasing
numbers, and to drive back the victorious legions
that were pouring down upon the allies,&mdash;a service
which would at once attest the intrinsic
worth of these corps; and their conduct proved
their genuine bravery, and showed that the same
valour, for which the corps had often been distinguished
as the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>, also glowed in
the bosoms of the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span>. The
two regiments instantly confronted the foe, and
conscious of their own power they dashed forward
upon the foaming ranks of the enemy, and used
their broad swords with dreadful execution. The
torrent of battle was arrested. The pursuing
squadrons were driven back, 'mangled with
many a ghastly wound,' and the remainder of
the army was enabled to make an undisturbed
retreat.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> After driving back the enemy's squadrons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span> retired, and
joined the main army, encamped at Saxenhausen,
on the same evening.</p>

<p>The loss of the regiment on this proud occasion
was thirty-five men and thirty-four horses; with
one man and two horses wounded.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>In consequence of some movements of the enemy
Prince Ferdinand proceeded with the main body
of the army towards Cassel, and on the 27th of
July the troops encamped near Kalle. At the
same time the Chevalier de Muy, who had succeeded
the Count de St. Germain, having crossed the
river Dymel with 35,000 men, and taken post on
the heights near <em>Warbourg</em>, with a view of cutting
off the communication of the allies with Westphalia,
Prince Ferdinand resolved to attack him in
this post. The attack commenced on the morning
of the 31st of July, and the brigade of Dragoon
Guards had another opportunity, which it did not
suffer to pass, of distinguishing itself. The action
had been maintained for a short time, although
only a part of the allied army had reached the
scene of conflict, and the English cavalry were a
distance of five miles in the rear, but they advanced
at great speed, at the same time preserving such
order and regularity as enabled them to charge
successfully the instant they arrived on the ground;
and after driving the enemy's cavalry out of
the field, they attacked the French infantry and
chased them from the heights with prodigious
slaughter. The town of Warbourg was carried.
The Dragoon Guards, led by the Marquis of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Granby,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> pressed forward in the pursuit, crossed
the Dymel, and the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span>,
after acquiring great honour in the fight and in
the pursuit, encamped that night on the heights
of Wilda.</p>

<p>The regiment only lost one man and five horses
in this engagement, with eight men and three
horses wounded.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the signal bravery of the British
troops, the enemy, by superior numbers, was
enabled to gain possession of several important
towns; and, on the advance of the main army under
the Duke de Broglio, the Dragoon Guards left
their advanced post at Wilda, repassed the Dymel,
and joined the lines near Warbourg on the 3rd of
August. During the remainder of the campaign
many brilliant services were performed by the
British troops and their allies. By secret and
expeditious movements, by daring and rapid advances,
and by sudden and unexpected attacks,
the enemy was kept in constant alarm; and this
warfare of detachments, in which the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon
Guards</span> took an active part, prevented the
French from deriving that advantage from their
superior numbers which had been anticipated. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the conclusion of the campaign the British troops
went into quarters in the bishopric of Paderborn,
where they suffered great hardship from a scarcity
of forage and provision.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1761</div>

<p>The French having, by their superior numbers,
gained possession of Hesse and the Lower Rhine,
amassed immense magazines of provision and
forage in convenient situations; and having secured
the communications necessary for their subsistence,
they possessed great advantages over the
allies, whose numbers were daily diminishing in
consequence of privations.</p>

<p>Prince Ferdinand, conscious of the difficulties
of his situation, formed one of those daring schemes
which he knew the innate ardour of his troops
would execute. In the most severe season of the
year, when military operations were least expected,
he made a sudden, extensive, and vigorous attack
upon the enemy's cantonments, threw the French
into the utmost consternation, and drove a superior
army before him for many miles. Having taken
several strong towns, and captured many of the
enemy's magazines, the allies returned to their
former quarters, and the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon
Guards</span> went into cantonments in the villages
near the banks of the Dymel.</p>

<p>On the advance of the French army in the middle
of June, 1761, the allies, having assembled
from their cantonments, marched in several
columns to Gesecke, and subsequently took post
with their left on the river Lippe, the left centre
under the Marquis of Granby at <em>Kirch-Denkern</em>,
and the right extending towards the village of
Werle; at the same time the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Guards</span> were posted on the heights of Wambeln.</p>

<p>The combined French armies, commanded by
Marshals Soubise and the Duke de Broglio, advanced
against the allies; frequent skirmishes
took place in the early part of July, and on the
15th of that month a furious attack was made upon
the post occupied by the Marquis of Granby; but
the enemy were repulsed and driven back to the
woods, where the fire of the skirmishers was kept
up throughout the night. The division of the
allied army commanded by the Prince of Anhalt
having been removed to support the Marquis of
Granby, a body of British troops, under Lieutenant-General
Conway, took possession of the ground
vacated by the Prince, being an eminence, between
Illingen and Hohenover; and here the brigade of
Dragoon Guards, commanded by Major-General
Douglas, was posted. On the following day the
French drove in the skirmishers, and renewed the
attack with additional forces, at the same time extending
the sphere of their operations; and an
attempt was made upon the post occupied by the
brigade of Dragoon Guards. The assailants were,
however, everywhere repulsed, and they were
eventually driven back with the loss of above 5000
men, 9 pieces of cannon, and 6 colours. Unfortunately
the nature of the ground prevented the
cavalry from taking part in the engagement.</p>

<p>In August the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span> were
engaged in a general attack upon the enemy's
posts, near the Dymel; and afterwards crossed
that river and advanced to the vicinity of Cassel.
In the early part of November they were engaged
in dislodging a French corps from its post near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
<em>Capelnhagen</em>. On the 6th and 7th of that month
they skirmished with the enemy's advanced posts
at <em>Eimbeck</em>, in the Electorate of Hanover. On
the same evening the Dragoon Guards, with several
other corps, marched through a heavy snow, and
the following morning arrived at <em>Foorwohle</em>, where
they erected their tents; but just as the encampment
was formed, an alarm was given by the out-posts
of the advance of the enemy in force. The
British horsemen instantly formed, attacked the
enemy with their accustomed gallantry, and drove
them back with loss. Prince Ferdinand was a
spectator of this act of gallantry, and expressed
great admiration of the spirited conduct of the
officers and men.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> This warfare by detached
parties, which occasioned considerable loss in men
and horses from fatigue and exposure to inclement
weather, produced no decisive results; and in the
beginning of November the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon
Guards</span> went into quarters in East Friesland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1762</div>

<p>In the spring of 1762 the allies made an excursion
into the country of Berg, where they raised
contributions. On the 18th of June the main
army encamped at Brakel, where the First and
<span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span> formed a brigade under
the command of Major-General the Earl of Pembroke.
On the 20th of the same month the army
advanced towards the Dymel; and the French,
under Marshals d'Etrées and Soubise moved forward
and encamped at <em>Groebenstien</em>; when a
favourable opportunity presenting itself, Prince
Ferdinand immediately made dispositions for attacking
the enemy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>
<p>Moving from their camp at an early hour on
the morning of the 24th of June the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon
Guards</span>, forming part of the centre column,
crossed the Dymel between Libenau and Silen, and
took part in surprising the enemy in their camp,
and in driving them from their ground, with the
loss of their camp equipage and many prisoners.
At the same time a French corps, consisting of
the grenadiers of France, the Royal Grenadiers,
the Regiment of Aquitaine, and other troops, under
the command of General Stainville, threw themselves
into the woods near Wilhelmsthal, to cover
the retreat of the army; when the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon
Guards</span>, with the main body of the allied
army, surrounded the wood, and nearly every man
of this French corps was either killed or taken
prisoner, two battalions only escaping.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span> afterwards pursued
the main body of the French army in the direction
of Cassel, and at night encamped on the heights
between Holtzhausen and Weimar.</p>

<p>In the middle of July the regiment took part in
an attack on the enemy's posts on the <em>Fulda</em>; and
was subsequently engaged in several military operations
on that river, and also on the Eder. By a
succession of combined operations the allies compelled
the enemy to evacuate a considerable portion
of territory, and the campaign ended with
the taking of Cassel. The success of the British
army was followed by a suspension of hostilities,
which took place in November, and the troops went
into quarters in the Bishopric of Munster.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1763</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span> having received,
in common with the whole army, the thanks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
of Parliament for their eminent and meritorious
services during the war, commenced their march
on the 27th of January, 1763, through Holland to
Williamstadt, where they embarked for England:
the numbers of the regiment on embarkation appear
to have been 14 officers, 328 men, and 434
horses, with 32 officers' servants, and 33 women
who had accompanied their husbands through these
long and toilsome campaigns.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>After its arrival in England the regiment was
stationed at Canterbury; and its establishment was
reduced to 28 private men per troop. At the same
time the <span class="fs80">LIGHT TROOP</span>, which had not been on
service with the remainder of the regiment, was
relieved from the King's duty at Windsor by the
15th Light Dragoons, and disbanded. Eight men
per troop of each of the old troops were, however,
subsequently equipped as <span class="fs80">LIGHT DRAGOONS</span>, a
practice which appears to have been general in the
heavy cavalry regiments.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>In consequence of a representation of the increase
of smuggling, and of the inability of the
officers of the revenue and civil authorities to resist,
successfully, the organized gangs which infested
the maritime towns and villages, the <span class="smcap">Third
Dragoon Guards</span> were dispersed in detachments
along the Kentish coast, the head-quarters
being at Canterbury.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1764</div>

<p>In April, 1764, the regiment was ordered to call
in its detachments and march into quarters near
London; and on the 14th of May it was reviewed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>in Hyde Park, by His Majesty King George III.,
who was pleased to express his approbation of the
uniform and compact appearance of the regiment,
and of the manner in which the various evolutions
were executed. After the review the regiment
marched to Leicester, Northampton, and Kettering.</p>


<p>This year His Majesty commanded the recruiting
and remounting of the several cavalry corps to
be submitted to the consideration of a Board of
General Officers; and in consequence of its report,
orders were issued for the recruits received
into the regiments of dragoon guards to be from
five feet eight inches to five feet ten inches in
height; and that the remount horses should not be
under fifteen hands, nor above fifteen hands one
inch: at the same time the several regiments were
ordered to be remounted with <em>long-tailed</em> horses:
jacked leather boots were also laid aside, and boots
of a lighter description were adopted; and the men
were ordered to wear epaulettes on the right
shoulder instead of aiguillettes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1765</div>

<p>The reputation which the regiment had acquired
in the field, and its uniform good conduct on all
occasions, attracted the attention of the King, and
in 1765 his Majesty was pleased to confer upon it
the title of <span class="smcap">The Prince of Wales' Regiment
of Dragoon Guards</span>, in honour of the heir
apparent to the throne (afterwards King George
IV.), who was then in the third year of his age:
at the same time it obtained,&mdash;as a regimental
badge,&mdash;a coronet, with a plume of three feathers,
a rising sun, and a red dragon, with the motto
'<span class="smcap">Ich Dien</span>.' In the month of March of the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
year, it proceeded to Scotland; and in September
Major-General Lord Robert Manners was appointed
its Colonel in succession to Sir Charles
Howard, deceased.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1766</div>

<p>In the spring of 1766 the regiment returned to
England, and was stationed at Manchester and its
vicinity. In July the <span class="smcap">Drummers</span> were taken off
the establishment, and <span class="smcap">Trumpeters</span> were appointed
in their place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1767<br />1768</div>

<p>The regiment left Manchester in April 1767,
and proceeded to Coventry, Warwick, and Birmingham.
In March of the succeeding year, the
several troops assembled at Coventry, from whence
they proceeded to Newbury and Speenham-Land,
and after having been reviewed by His Majesty on
Bagshot Heath, marched to quarters at Dorchester,
Sherbourn, and Blandford.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1769<br />1770<br />1772</div>

<p>In 1769 the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span> were
on coast duty in Sussex, with their head-quarters
at Lewes. After calling in the detachments, the
regiment assembled at Chichester in 1770, from
whence it proceeded to the vicinity of London,
and had the honour of passing in review before
His Majesty on Blackheath. In May it marched
to Colchester, Chelmsford, and Ingatestone; and
in the spring of 1772 proceeded to Scotland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1773<br />1777</div>

<p>After remaining in Scotland twelve months,
the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span> returned to England
and occupied quarters in South Britain, until
the spring of 1777, when they again proceeded
to the north.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1778</div>

<p>The nation was at this period engaged in a war
with its North American colonies, and the French
monarch having agreed to assist the revolted pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>vincials,
the army was augmented, and during
the time this regiment was in Scotland, an addition
of one serjeant, one corporal, and fifteen
private men was made to the establishment. It
returned to England in April, and in May a
squadron was in attendance on the King and
Queen at Portsmouth, whither their Majesties
proceeded to witness a naval review, &amp;c. In
August, a further addition of eight men, who were
to be equipped as light dragoons, was made to its
numbers. During the summer it was encamped
on Salisbury Plain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1779</div>

<p>In 1779 the men of the <span class="smcap">Prince of Wales'
Dragoon Guards</span> equipped as light dragoons,
with the men of the 1st, 6th, and 11th Dragoons
were formed into a regiment, which was
numbered the 20th regiment of Light Dragoons;
and from this period the heavy regiments ceased
to have a portion of their men equipped as light
cavalry.</p>

<p>During the summer the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon
Guards</span> with the 1st Royal Dragoons, and the
15th, 20th, and 21st Light Dragoons, were encamped
on Lexdon Heath, near Colchester.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1780</div>

<p>During the summer of 1780 the regiment was
stationed at Shrewsbury, and on the breaking out
of the memorable riots in London, it was suddenly
called upon to proceed thither. Severe measures
being found absolutely necessary to preserve the
metropolis from destruction, the suppression of
these riots was a painful service to the troops, and
the violence of the misguided people was so great,
that about 300 rioters fell victims to their own
folly, before order was restored.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Prince of Wales' Dragoon Guards</span>
returned to their quarters at Shrewsbury in July,
where they continued for some time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1782</div>

<p>On the 7th of June, 1782, his Majesty conferred
the Colonelcy on Lieut.-General Philip Honeywood
from the 4th Regiment of Irish Horse (now
7th Dragoon Guards), in the place of Lord
Robert Manners, deceased.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1783</div>

<p>After the British Government had recognised
the independence of the United States of America,
the strength of the army was reduced, and the
establishment of the <span class="smcap">Prince of Wales' Dragoon
Guards</span> was decreased 154 men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1785</div>

<p>The decease of General Honeywood having occurred
in January, 1785, his Majesty appointed
Major-General Richard Burton Philipson Colonel
of the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1788<br />1789</div>

<p>The regiment continued in England until the
spring of 1788, when it again proceeded to Scotland,
and remained in that kingdom the usual
period of one year. After its arrival in England,
in 1789, the establishment was increased nine men
per troop.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1792</div>

<p>In August, 1792, the Colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Prince
of Wales' Dragoon Guards</span>, vacant by the
decease of General Philipson, was conferred on
Major-General Sir William Fawcett, K.B., then
Adjutant-General of the Forces.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1793</div>

<p>A further augmentation was made in the establishment
in the spring of 1793, with a view to
its being employed in actual warfare against the
revolutionary party in France, who had seized the
reins of government in that country, and beheaded
their sovereign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>A French army under General Dumourier, having
attacked the frontiers of Holland, a British
force was sent to the continent under the command
of His Royal Highness the Duke of York,
to co-operate with the Austrians, Prussians, and
Dutch; and on the 25th of May, four troops of
the <span class="smcap">Prince of Wales' Dragoon Guards</span> embarked
at Northfleet for this service. Having
landed at Ostend, they advanced to the vicinity of
Tournay, and formed part of a corps of reserve to
the covering army during the siege of <em>Valenciennes</em>,
which place surrendered to His Royal
Highness the Duke of York on the 26th of July.
The siege of <em>Dunkirk</em> was next undertaken, with
the view of replacing that fortress under the dominion
of England, and the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon
Guards</span> formed part of the force employed in
covering the operation. The enemy having
brought forward an immense body of troops, attacked
the covering army with great fury; when
some severe fighting occurred, during which the
<span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span>, owing to the nature of
the ground, had to dismount and act as infantry;
and the covering army, being eventually driven
from its ground by the superior numbers of the
enemy, the Duke of York raised the siege. The
British troops afterwards returning to the vicinity
of Tournay, were engaged in several skirmishes
with the enemy; and towards the end of the year
the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span> proceeded to
Ghent and Bruges for winter quarters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1794</div>

<p>Early in 1794 the regiment was again in the
field; and it was engaged in the general attack on
the enemy's positions at <em>Vaux</em>, <em>Premont</em>, <em>Marets</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
and <em>Catillon</em>, on the 17th of April; and was subsequently
encamped, with nearly the whole of the
British army, on the heights of <em>Cateau</em>, to cover
the siege of <em>Landrécies</em>, which was undertaken by
the Austrians.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 25th of April a French
corps of about 30,000 men, commanded by Lieut.-General
Chapuy, marched out of Cambray, and
on the following morning advanced against the
British troops. At day-break the enemy formed
line, and being concealed by a thick fog, took possession
of a village in front of the British position.
At length their movements being plainly seen,
His Royal Highness detached the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon
Guards</span> and other cavalry of the right wing,
to turn the enemy's left flank; and this movement
having been executed, the British squadrons
charged with their characteristic gallantry, overthrew
the troops of the enemy, and pursued them
to the gates of Cambray. In the midst of the conflict
the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span>, ever emulous
of glory, were seen carrying destruction and defeat
through the enemy's ranks; and in their victorious
career, the allies captured thirty-five pieces
of cannon, with a number of prisoners, amongst
whom was the French commander, Lieut.-General
Chapuy, who surrendered his sword to Major
Tiddieman, the commanding-officer of the <span class="smcap">Third
Dragoon Guards</span>.</p>

<p>The regiment, however, purchased its laurels
with the loss of Captain Pigot, Lieutenant Fellowes,
1 quarter-master, 1 serjeant, 36 private
men, and 46 horses killed, besides a great number
wounded. His Royal Highness the Duke of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
York expressed his admiration of its conduct,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
and inserted the following paragraph in the
General Orders issued on this occasion.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>'The Austrian Regiment of Cuirassiers of
Zetchwitz, the Blues, the 1st, 3rd, and 5th
Dragoon Guards, the Royals, Archduke Ferdinand's
Hussars, and the 16th Light Dragoons,
who attacked and defeated the principal column
of the enemy on the right, <span class="fs80">HAVE ALL ACQUIRED
IMMORTAL HONOUR TO THEMSELVES</span>.'</p></div>

<p>After the surrender of <em>Landrécies</em>, the <span class="smcap">Third
Dragoon Guards</span> marched to the vicinity of
<em>Tournay</em>, and on the 10th of May were engaged
in repulsing the attack of the enemy, whose troops
were forced across the Marque, with the loss of
thirteen pieces of cannon. The regiment behaved
on this occasion with its accustomed gallantry;
and sustained a loss of 2 officers, 1 serjeant, and
14 private men, with 25 horses killed; and 2
officers, 2 serjeants, 6 men, and 2 horses wounded.</p>

<p>The allies subsequently sustained several severe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
losses in actions with the enemy, and the Austrians
having resolved to abandon the Netherlands,
the Duke of York, who had maintained his position
in front of Tournay against all opposition,
was obliged to make a corresponding movement.
The <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span> shared, in common
with the other regiments, the hardships which
this event occasioned. In the subsequent retreat
through Holland, which was occasioned in a great
measure by the defection of the Dutch people, the
incessant fatigue, the inclemency of the season,
and the difficulty experienced in procuring supplies,
reduced the British troops to a most distressing
state of ill health, and occasioned the death of
hundreds of brave men. At length the Maese and
the Waal were frozen; the French, with their
cannon and all the <em>matériel</em> of their army, passed
these rivers on the ice: some hard fighting occurred,
but the British, in their reduced condition,
were unable to oppose effectual resistance. The
army retired in the midst of a rigorous winter,
through a hostile country covered with ice and
snow, without necessaries, and without accommodation:
consequently numbers perished from
want, and others were frozen to death; yet the
survivors preserved a firm and undaunted countenance,
and defeated the attacks of the pursuing
army. 'Such was the fate of as brave a body of
men as ever Great Britain sent into the field.
Both men and officers behaved themselves
throughout the whole of the campaigns of 1793
and 1794, with a spirit that distinguished them
wherever they were employed, and that fully
corresponded with that idea of British valour, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
justly entertained by foreign nations. It was,
however, in the last stages of this unsuccessful
campaign that their courage appeared with the
most lustre. The undesponding perseverance
with which they met and surmounted every hardship
and obstacle, arising from the various incidents
of war, was the more remarkable, that they
contended against an enemy in full possession of
every advantage occurring from victory, and
whom they could only expect to impress with a
sense of their valour. Herein they certainly
succeeded.'<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1795</div>

<p>Having arrived at Bremen, in Lower Saxony,
the troops there obtained provision and rest. The
infantry embarked for England in April, 1795;
but the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span>, and several
other cavalry regiments, remained in Germany
until November, when they returned to England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1799</div>

<p>In the summer of 1799 the regiment was encamped
near Swinley, under the command of
Lieut.-Colonel Payne, and was this year ordered
to be mounted on nag-tailed horses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1800</div>

<p>It was again encamped at Swinley in the summer
of 1800, and was reviewed on the downs by
his Majesty King George III., who was pleased
to express to Lieut.-Colonel Payne, through Sir
William Fawcett, the colonel of the regiment, his
high approbation of the appearance of the officers
and men, and of the superior description and high
condition of the horses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1803<br />1804</div>

<p>In 1803 it proceeded to Scotland, and was stationed
at Piershill Barracks, near Edinburgh;
from whence it marched, in February, 1804, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Portpatrick, and embarked for Ireland. After
debarking at Donaghadee, it occupied quarters at
Londonderry, Enniskillen, Dundalk, and Belturbet.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of April, 1804, His Majesty appointed
Major-General Richard Vyse to the Colonelcy
of the <span class="smcap">Third or Prince of Wales' own
Regiment of Dragoon Guards</span>, in succession
to General Sir William Fawcett, K.B., deceased.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1805</div>

<p>In the summer the regiment marched to Dublin,
from whence it subsequently proceeded to Limerick,
Fermoy, Mallow, and Bandon, and returned to
Dublin in December, 1805.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1808</div>

<p>Orders having been given for the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon
Guards</span> to join the intended expedition to
the Continent, one-half of the regiment embarked
from Dublin and sailed to Liverpool, but the expedition,
having been countermanded, on the arrival
of the remainder of the regiment, the whole proceeded
to Exeter, where the head-quarters were
stationed until June, 1808, when the regiment
marched to Dorchester; and shortly afterwards to
Chichester and Arundel.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span> were present at
the review which took place at Brighton on the
12th of August, 1808, in honour of the birth-day
of his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales. They
afterwards occupied quarters at Brighton and
Lewes, and in the autumn they were called upon
to hold themselves in readiness to proceed on
foreign service, to participate in the victories gained
by the British forces in Portugal and Spain serving
under that illustrious commander, now Arthur
Duke of Wellington, whose splendid achievements
are interwoven with the history of Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>The regiment embarked at Portsmouth on the
5th of December, but afterwards disembarked and
returned to its former quarters, from whence it
proceeded to Hastings and other places in that part
of the country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1809</div>

<p>In March, 1809, it again proceeded to Portsmouth,
where eight troops, of eighty-eight horses
each, embarked on the 3rd and 4th of April, under
the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Granby
Calcraft, leaving two troops at Blatchington, where
the dépôt was established under the command of
Lieutenant-Colonel Watson.</p>

<p>The Fleet sailed on the 17th of April, and two
days afterwards the Doris transport was run down
by the Bonne Citoyenne, in the Bay of Biscay, and
thirty troop horses and two officers' horses were
lost.</p>

<p>Having landed at Lisbon on the 26th and 27th
of April, the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span> proceeded
to Belem barracks, and were formed in brigade
with the Fourth Dragoons, under the command of
Brigadier-General Henry Fane. From Belem
they proceeded on the 4th of May up the country,
and on the 10th of that month occupied quarters at
Golegon and Torres Novas. On the 22nd the head-quarters
were at Thomar, and on the 11th of June
they encamped on the picturesque grounds near the
banks of the Tagus at Abrantes, where Lieutenant-General
Sir Arthur Wellesley had recently arrived
from a successful expedition on the Douro.</p>

<p>Towards the end of June the army advanced.
The <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span> left Abrantes on
the 28th of that month, and, having entered Spain,
were encamped, on the 10th of July, at Plasencia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Advancing from thence on the 18th of July, the
army crossed the Tietar, and proceeding along the
romantic valley of the Tagus, formed two columns
on the 22nd, with the view of attacking the French
posts at <em>Talavera de la Reyna</em>. A body of Spanish
troops came up with the enemy's rear-guard
near the village of Gamonal, when 2000 French
dragoons obliged the Spanish general to display
his whole line of 15,000 infantry and 3000 cavalry;
nor did the French horsemen attempt to fall back
until they perceived the scarlet uniforms of the
British cavalry on their right, when they retired;
and the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span> took a conspicuous
part in the pursuit. They afterwards
crossed the Alberche to Cazalegas, and took post
in front of the army to sustain the Spanish corps.</p>

<p>The advance of a French force, commanded by
Joseph Buonaparte, being immediately followed
by the defeat and precipitate retreat of the Spaniards
in front, the British commander took up a
position,&mdash;his right on <em>Talavera de la Reyna</em>, and
his left on the steep hills which bounded the woody
plain; when the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span> took
their station in rear of the left.</p>

<p>The action commenced on the 27th of July, and
was renewed on the following day. A great part
of the Spanish army fled at the commencement of
the battle; the English, however, maintained their
ground, and many of the Spaniards were induced
to return to their posts. The several attacks were
made with the usual impetuosity of the French
soldiers. The advancing columns were, however,
met with a firmness and constancy which confounded
the assailants, and in every instance the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
enemy was repulsed and driven back with loss.
On the 28th the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span> and
Fourth Dragoons, having moved into the plain to
the left, advanced to charge a column of the enemy's
infantry, but the attack was countermanded,
and the two regiments, after supporting the charge
of Major-General Anson's brigade, were ordered
to resume their former position. On this occasion
Captain Brice, of the regiment, was severely
wounded by a cannon ball. At length the enemy,
repulsed in every attack by the British infantry,
and driven back with dreadful carnage, retired,
leaving seventeen pieces of cannon in possession of
the English. The gallant bearing of the <span class="smcap">Third
Dragoon Guards</span> in this action procured them
the royal permission to bear the word <span class="smcap">Talavera</span>
on their standards.</p>

<p>Little advantage resulted from this splendid display
of valour, the enemy having so great a superiority
of numbers that, at the time the action took
place, a French army, commanded by Marshal
Soult, was advancing upon the rear of the allies.
Information having been received that this force
had entered Plasencia, Sir Arthur Wellesley,
leaving the greater part of the Spanish force at
Talavera, proceeded on the 3rd of August with the
British troops to meet the advancing enemy. The
Spaniards, however, ascertained that a French
force was advancing on Talavera, and they instantly
retired, leaving the British sick and wounded
to the mercy of the enemy. At the same time
Sir Arthur Wellesley ascertained that the force in
his front was far more numerous than he expected,
and he found himself in a critical situation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>The allied army did not exceed 47,000 men,
and the greater part of these were Spaniards: the
British, owing to the neglect and apathy of the
Spanish authorities, had been some time without
a regular supply of provision, and the strength of
the men was exhausted. In front was Marshal
Soult, with 53,000 men, in the rear was a French
army of about 40,000, on the right were impassable
mountains, and on the left the river Tagus.
Under these circumstances the British commander
resolved not to attack the enemy, but to cross the
bridge of Arzobispo, and take up a defensive line
behind the river. The bridge was accordingly
crossed on the 4th of August, and by two o'clock
the army was in position on the opposite banks.
From Arzobispo the army proceeded towards
Deleytoza, the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span> covering
the retreat, and on the evening of the 4th of August
they joined the camp near Truxillo. On the 10th
they were again in motion, and having arrived at
Merida on the 20th they encamped on the banks
of the Guadiana on the 26th of that month, where
they remained nine weeks. Extraordinary fatigue,
added to a want of food, had already reduced the
British troops to a very weak and unhealthy state,
and whilst in this condition they were attacked by
a malignant fever, which proved fatal to great
numbers both of officers and men. The <span class="smcap">Third
Dragoon Guards</span> lost on this occasion one major,
two captains, two lieutenants, and many non-commissioned
officers and private men.</p>

<p>The regiment was removed from the camp on the
28th of October, to quarters in the town, and it
subsequently retired into the valley of the Mondego.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
During the winter the Spanish army was defeated,
captured, or dispersed. The British remained in
Portugal, and their commander was created Baron
Douro and Viscount Wellington.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1810</div>

<p>Before the opening of the following campaign
the French army in the Peninsula was considerably
reinforced; fresh troops, flushed with their recent
German victories, were crowding into Spain, to
the amount of nearly 100,000 men; and in the
spring of 1810 the enemy's force in the Peninsula
exceeded 300,000 men. The British commander
could no longer calculate upon offensive operations:
he, however, resolved to attempt the preservation of
Portugal, and made his admirable arrangements
accordingly. The ground fixed upon for a final
stand was near Lisbon; but the troops continued
in advance of this position as long as possible. The
<span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span> were in motion on the
18th of February, 1810, and they arrived at
Coimbra on the 23rd; advancing from thence on
the 29th of April, they reached Mongauldo and
Viseu on the 3rd of May, where a remount of
thirty-five men and thirty-three horses joined
from England, under the command of Captain
Watts.</p>

<p>On the 13th of May Brigadier-General the Honourable
G. de Grey was appointed to the command
of the brigade composed of the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon
Guards</span> and Fourth Dragoons.</p>

<p>The French army designed to act against Portugal
advanced, under the command of Marshal
Massena, Prince of Esling, who, meeting with no
force capable of resisting his numerous legions,
soon took Ciudad Rodrigo, and invested Almeida.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Lord Wellington, having resolved to retire, sent
the cavalry forward to Freixedas, and, on the 28th
of July, the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span> took post at
Minncae, while the infantry retired behind the
Mondego, except the fourth division, which remained
at Guarda. The explosion of the magazine
at Almeida having decided the fate of that
place, and accelerated the advance of the enemy,
Lord Wellington fixed his cavalry at Celerico, with
posts of observation at Guarda and Trancoso. The
enemy advancing in force, the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon
Guards</span>, and other corps, retired on the 15th of
September, passed the Mondego, and on the 19th
encamped on a plain in front of Montagao. In
the mean time a remount of twenty-three men and
forty-seven horses joined the regiment under Cornet
Homewood. The retreat was continued, and on
the 23rd of September the regiment arrived at Busaco,
and encamped at Villa Nova, in rear of the
main body of the army.</p>

<p>The French army was marching upon Lisbon,
and Marshal Massena vaunted that he would drive
the English into the sea, and the imperial eagles
should triumph in the capital of Portugal, when
suddenly the rocks of <em>Busaco</em> were seen bristling
with bayonets and streaming with British colours.
On the 27th of September the French attacked
the heights: ascending, with wonderful alacrity
the mountain sides, they stormed the position; but
were repulsed and driven back with immense
slaughter. The <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span> were
in reserve in the rear, the conflict being on the
steep and rugged sides of rocks and mountains,
where cavalry could not engage. The enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
having failed in the attack, endeavoured to turn the
left flank of the position, when Lord Wellington
immediately retired. The inhabitants in the vicinity
were all required to quit their homes and proceed
with their provisions and movable property
in front of the army, and the population (all orders,
sexes, and ages) retired like a cloud behind the
lines of Torres Vedras, where a series of works,
connected with ranges of rocks and mountains,
formed something like a fortified citadel of vast
extent, which covered Lisbon.</p>

<p>The first range of defence extended about twenty
miles; the second, and principal range, was from
six to ten miles in rear of the first, and it extended
about twenty-nine miles; and, at a considerable
distance in the rear of the second, was
formed a third range of defences: one flank was
protected by a flotilla of gun-boats on the Tagus,
manned by British seamen; and the other flank
by the sea.</p>

<p>Here Lord Wellington resolved to make a decisive
stand. The French commander was astounded
when he discovered this formidable barrier, against
which his superior numbers could not prevail. After
making several reconnoissances, and skirmishing
with the advanced posts, he relinquished his design
and commenced retiring upon Santarem, when
the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span> advanced in pursuit,
and succeeded in capturing several prisoners.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1811</div>

<p>After arriving at Santarem the enemy collected
his means, called to his aid additional forces, and
prepared to make a mighty effort. The British
army was also augmented, and the defences increased.
At length the French army was so re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>duced
from sickness and other causes, that Marshal
Massena was under the necessity of retreating, and
having destroyed a great quantity of stores and artillery,
which he could not remove, he retired on the
night of the 5th of March, 1811. The allied army
moved forward in pursuit, harassing and attacking
the enemy's rear with varied success. The French
were guilty of the most enormous acts of barbarity
and cruelty upon the unfortunate Portuguese peasantry;
and, when occasion offered, the latter retaliated,
so that the line of march presented a mingled
spectacle of horror, carnage, and devastation.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>On the 15th of March the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon
Guards</span> had arrived at Condeixa, from whence
Captain E. R. Story, (now Lieut.-Colonel,) of the
regiment, was ordered to reconnoitre with his troop,
and ascertain if the enemy were in possession of
Coimbra, and while performing this service he fell
in with a party of French dragoons, and took six
men and horses prisoners. Captain Story ascertained
that the Portuguese were in possession of
Coimbra and of the bridge, and that the enemy
had retired up the left bank of the Mondego: the
troop then returned to head-quarters. On the following
day the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span> were
despatched across the Tagus towards Badajoz,
which place had recently been taken by a division
of the French army, commanded by Marshal Soult.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Continuing their route, they had an encounter with
the enemy near Badajoz on the 25th of March.
The French sustained considerable loss, but the
<span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span> had only two men
killed and one wounded. On the 1st of April
they were at Villa Vicosa, and on the 7th they
crossed the river Guadiana at Juramenha.</p>

<p>On the 16th of April the camp broke up from
Santa Martha, on which day the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon
Guards</span>, after marching five leagues, came up with
a corps of French cavalry near <em>Los Santos</em>, and,
notwithstanding the disparity of numbers, immediately
charged, defeated, and pursued them above
two leagues, taking nearly 200 prisoners: in this
gallant affair the regiment sustained but trifling
loss.</p>

<p>On the 20th of the same month the regiment was
again in motion, and took post at Villa Franca. In
the mean time Badajoz had been invested by the
allies, and Marshal Soult was advancing with a
powerful army, to the relief of the place. Marshal
Beresford, who commanded this portion of the
allied army, resolved to take up a position at <em>Albuhera</em>;
when the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span> proceeded
by Almendralejo to Santa Martha, and were
at their post in the army when the French attacked
the allied forces on the morning of the 16th of May.
In the early part of the action the enemy gained
considerable advantage: a powerful effort was,
however, made by the allies, and 'then was seen
with what a strength and majesty the British
soldier fights.'<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> The French, repulsed and driven
back, relinquished the contest, leaving thousands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
of their hostile legions stretched along the plain.
The allied army also sustained great loss, particularly
the English infantry. The <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon
Guards</span>, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel
Sir Granby Calcraft, contributed materially to the
success of the day: they lost one lieutenant, thirteen
men, and twenty-one horses; and His Majesty King
William IV. was graciously pleased, on the 5th of
May, 1837, to grant permission to the regiment
to bear on its standards and appointments the word
'<span class="smcap">Albuhera</span>,' in commemoration of the gallantry
displayed in that battle.</p>

<p>On the 18th of May the enemy retired, followed
by part of the army, and by the cavalry, under
Major-General Lumley. On the 25th the <span class="smcap">Third
Dragoon Guards</span> and Fourth Dragoons were
formed up in front of <em>Usagre</em>, when three of the
enemy's 'chosen regiments (the Fourth, Twentieth,
and Twenty-sixth) dashed through the town and
formed rapidly on the flank of the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon
Guards</span> and in front of the Fourth Dragoons,
themselves presenting two fronts. A
charge of the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span> was at
this moment ordered on the right, and a simultaneous
movement of the Fourth Dragoons on the
left.'<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Major Weston, who commanded the
<span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span> on that day (Lieutenant-Colonel
Sir Granby Calcraft having been
left sick in the rear) led the regiment forward
with admirable gallantry. The charge was irresistible.
The French, notwithstanding their superiority
of numbers, were overthrown, pursued,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
many of them sabred, and one lieutenant-colonel,
two majors, and several other officers,
with ninety-six non-commissioned officers and
men were made prisoners; a great number of
horses were also captured, the French dragoons
having dismounted to effect their escape across a
ravine. In this brilliant affair the regiment only
lost four men; and, on the 27th of May, it returned
to Villa Franca, having been nearly without forage
the two preceding days.</p>

<p>Badajoz was again invested by the allies; and
the enemy collected another immense body of troops,
and advanced to relieve the place; when the siege
was raised and the troops were withdrawn across
the Guadiana. The <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span>
marched from Villa Franca on the 13th of June,
crossed the Guadiana on the 17th, and encamped
on the small river Caya, near Campo Mayor. In
July the establishment of that part of the regiment
which was on foreign service was reduced to six
troops, making a total of 495 rank and file; and
the supernumerary officers and men of the two
transferred troops were sent to England.</p>

<p>On the 21st of July the regiment proceeded to
Evora, from whence it marched, on the 1st of
August, crossed the Tagus at Villa Velha, and
proceeded by Castello Branco to Fondao, and subsequently
to Alverça. On the 4th of September
it occupied Ansale and adjacents; on the 25th it
advanced to Guinaldo, to support the piquets; and
in the night the whole retired to Quadrasages. On
the 2nd of October it went into quarters at Avelans
de Bon; and on the 3rd of December occupied
Momento and Cea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1812</div>

<p>Lord Wellington having resolved to besiege
<em>Ciudad Rodrigo</em>, the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span>
were ordered to advance and cover the investing
army. They accordingly marched from Cea and
Momento, on the 1st of January, 1812, arrived at
Santo Spirito on the 15th, and established posts on
the river Yeltes. <em>Ciudad Rodrigo</em> was taken by
storm on the 19th; and for this distinguished
service the Spanish Government elevated the British
commander to the rank of grandee of the first
class, with the title of Duke of Ciudad Rodrigo.</p>

<p>The siege of <em>Badajoz</em> was next undertaken.
On the 27th of January the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon
Guards</span> marched for Freiz and Leomil, near
the Douro, and arrived there on the 7th of February.
On the 18th they were again in motion,
and proceeding by Mysando de Corvo, and Thomar,
crossed the Tagus at Abrantes, and the Guadiana,
near Olivenza, and arrived at Rebeira on the 19th
of March. Seven days afterwards they were again
on the march, forming part of a force under Lieutenant-General
Sir Thomas Graham, destined to
surprise a body of French troops at <em>Llecena</em>: when
the enemy, after some resistance, retired to Azuaga,
from whence they were driven on the 29th of March.</p>

<p>The regiment formed part of the army of observation
under Lieutenant-General Sir Thomas
Graham, and accompanied the movements of this
force until after the capture of <em>Badajoz</em>, when
Lord Wellington marched with the main body of
the army towards Castile. The <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon
Guards</span> were stationed at Villa Franca and Rebeira,
being formed in brigade with the First
Royal Dragoons, under the orders of Major-Ge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>neral
Slade, and were attached to a separate corps
of the army, commanded by Lieutenant-General
Sir Rowland Hill: subsequently the regiment advanced
to Llera.</p>

<p>On the 11th of June the enemy's General,
L'Allemand, advanced upon <em>Llera</em>, with the 17th
and 29th regiments of French dragoons. Major-General
Slade moved forward with the <span class="smcap">Third
Dragoon Guards</span> and Royal Dragoons, when the
two regiments made a brilliant charge, and defeated
and pursued the enemy nearly three leagues. On
arriving within a short distance of <em>Maguilla</em> the
two British regiments had an opportunity of making
a second charge, which they executed in gallant
style, and having broken the enemy's first
line, slew a number of men, and took many others,
with one of General L'Allemand's aides-de-camp,
prisoners. At length the enemy brought forward
a strong support; and the two regiments being
eager in the pursuit, each vying with the other
which should most distinguish itself, were attacked
by the enemy, forced to relinquish a number of
prisoners, and to retire upon Llera. Major-General
Slade concluded his despatch with observing,
'Nothing could exceed the gallantry displayed by
the officers and men on this occasion. Colonel Sir
Granby Calcraft and Lieutenant-Colonel Clifton,
commanding the two regiments, particularly distinguished
themselves, as well as all the officers
present. I beg particularly to report the conduct
of Brigade-Major Radcliffe, to whom I feel particularly
indebted for his assistance on this occasion.'
The <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span> had thirteen
men killed; and Lieutenant Homewood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
sixty-seven men, and eighty-five horses were taken
by the enemy.</p>

<p>On the following day a detachment from the
<span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span> and Royal Dragoons,
consisting of about twenty men of each regiment,
commanded by Lieutenant Strenuitz (aide-de-camp
to Sir William Erskine) formed an ambush
to intercept a strong foraging party of the enemy's
cavalry. The party of the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon
Guards</span> was destined to commence the attack,
and was placed, for that purpose, under the command
of troop-serjeant-major M'Clelland (who had
formerly distinguished himself); and the Royals
formed the reserve. The detachment came in
contact with the French at a village near <em>Belango</em>;
the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span> charged with all
the spirit and fire of Britons. The fury of the
onset threw the enemy into confusion; they at
once gave way and fled in all directions, leaving
several officers and men, and a great number of
horses, in the hands of the victors. The success of
this gallant affair enabled the regiment to retrieve,
by exchange with the enemy, the greatest part of
the loss sustained on the preceding day.</p>

<p>The French having considerable reinforcements
at hand, Sir Rowland Hill retired by Santa Martha
to Albuhera, where the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span>
were joined by a remount from England, consisting
of two serjeants, forty-two private men, and
sixty horses.</p>

<p>On the 1st of July the regiment had another
opportunity of signalizing itself in conflict. A
strong body of French cavalry having succeeded in
driving in the Spanish out-posts, was threatening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the safety of the British camp at Albuhera, which
was covered by the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span>, when
a picquet of about twenty men of the regiment,
under the command of Captain E. R. Story, who
perceived the extreme danger of the camp and the
necessity of a check, stood the charge of the French
squadrons; and having ultimately received a
reinforcement of a squadron of the regiment, under
Captain Watts, repulsed the attack, charged in
turn, and finally compelled the enemy to retreat,
recovering, at the same time, the prisoners which
the French had taken in the first onset. On this
occasion Lieutenant Ellis, one serjeant, one trumpeter,
and two private men of the picquet, were
killed; and Captain Watts, whose squadron reinforced
the picquet, was wounded. This important
and valuable service, performed at so critical a
moment, occasioned an order for every man of the
<span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span> to be supplied with an
extra ration of rum; and the following brigade
order was published on the same day.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>'Major-General Slade is most happy in the opportunity
which the Third Dragoon Guards
have afforded him of thanking them for the gallantry
and steadiness with which they repulsed
an attack made by the enemy's cavalry this afternoon;
particularly the picquet under the command
of Captain E. R. Story, and the supporting squadron,
commanded by Captain Watts. He requests
those officers, with the officers and men
under their command, will be pleased to accept
his grateful acknowledgments.</p>

<p>'The Major-General particularly regrets the
loss of Lieutenant Ellis, who nobly fell at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
head of his men: he has also to lament Captain
Watts being wounded, but he hopes not dangerously
so, and that the regiment will not be deprived
of his services long.'</p>
</div>

<p>The camp at Albuhera broke up on the following
day, and the troops advanced upon the enemy,
who retired upon Cordova. The <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon
Guards</span> proceeded by Los Santos to Llerena;
and occupied Fuente del Mastre on the 24th of
July, on which day they were suddenly called upon
to make a flank movement with the view of gaining
the rear of two regiments of French dragoons
and one of chasseurs, who had driven in the Portuguese
picquet, and were advancing upon <em>Villa
Franca</em>. The regiment passed through Los
Santos, and, advancing at a quick pace, soon
reached Hinojosa; but the French had made a
precipitate retreat, and had quitted the town a
short period before the Dragoon Guards arrived.</p>

<p>After the main army had gained a signal victory
at <em>Salamanca</em> (for which Lord Wellington
was advanced to the dignity of Marquis), the
French hastily retired before the troops commanded
by Lieutenant-General Hill, who took up a position
on the Tagus. The <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span>
marched by Usagre, Balangur, and Villa, crossed
the Tagus at Almaraz on the 19th of September,
and occupied Belois: from whence they moved on
the 26th, re-crossed the Tagus at Talavera de la
Reyna, and arrived at Tombleque, in La Mancha,
on the 8th of October; and, on the 21st, occupied
some villages on the right bank of the Tagus.</p>

<p>The French army opposed to the Marquis of
Wellington having been considerably reinforced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
his lordship retired from Burgos, and Sir Rowland
Hill collected the troops under his command on the
Jacamah, from whence he retired upon Anvalo.
Having crossed the Manzanarus by the bridge
Ponto Largo, near Arranheuse, the army took up
a position, on the 27th of October, on the right
bank of the river; and the light brigade of infantry
was employed during the afternoon in defending
the bridge, which had been mined for destruction,
but the attempt did not succeed. During the
night the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span> relieved the
infantry at the bridge, two-thirds of the regiment
having been dismounted for that purpose.</p>

<p>The troops retreating by Madrid, through the
Guadarama pass, formed a junction with the army
commanded by the Marquis of Wellington at
Salamanca, the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span>, on this
occasion, forming part of the rear-guard. During
the retreat the regiment was joined by a remount
from England, consisting of four lieutenants, two
serjeants, two corporals, twenty private men, and
forty-six horses.</p>

<p>On the 15th of November the army retired on
Ciudad Rodrigo, when the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon
Guards</span> were again employed in covering the
retreat, and suffered much from the inclemency of
the weather, but more especially from the scarcity
of forage and provisions. On the 20th they went
into quarters at Herquera, and on the 27th proceeded
to Membrio, where a remount, consisting
of one lieutenant, one cornet, two serjeants, fifty-seven
private men, and fifty-horses, joined on the
29th of November.</p>

<p>In a warrant, dated the 12th of August, 1812,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
the facing of the regiment was changed from
<em>white</em> to <em>blue</em>; cocked hats were replaced by brass
helmets; jacked boots and breeches by cloth overalls
and short boots; and the skirts of the coats
were shortened.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1813</div>

<p>On the 25th of January, 1813, the six troops on
foreign service marched to St. Vincent, where the
forage being good and plentiful, the horses soon recovered
their condition. On the 5th of March they
re-crossed the Tagus at Alcantara, and on the
11th went into quarters at Gigo de Coria, where a
draught of ninety-four horses joined from the
Fourth Dragoon Guards.</p>

<p>Arrangements having been made for the advance
of the army against the enemy, the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon
Guards</span> left Gigo de Coria on the 16th of
May, and accompanying the second division, under
Sir Rowland Hill, advanced through the mountains
by the pass of Banos, and crossed the river
Tormes below <em>Salamanca</em>. On the 26th of May
they came up with the rear-guard of the enemy,
covering the retreat from <em>Salamanca</em>, and being
supported by the Royal Dragoons, and a troop of
horse artillery, succeeded in taking upwards of 500
prisoners.</p>

<p>The enemy continuing to retreat, the allied army
directed its march on Valladolid. The <span class="smcap">Third
Dragoon Guards</span> crossed the Douro at Toro on
the 3rd of June, and continued to press upon the
rear of the French army in its retreat.</p>

<p>On the 21st of June the regiment, commanded by
Lieutenant-Colonel Holmes, marched early in the
morning towards <em>Vittoria</em>, where the French army,
commanded by Joseph Bonaparte and Marshal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Jourdan, was concentrated and formed in position.
A general engagement immediately commenced.
During the early part of the day the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon
Guards</span> manœuvred in conjunction with, and
supported the attacks of, the infantry; but towards
the evening they moved forward and made a brilliant
and decisive charge on a corps of French
cavalry and a column of infantry, which were covering
the retreat of several pieces of cannon and a
number of waggons laden with ammunition and
treasure: the enemy was defeated, driven from his
ground, and the guns and waggons were captured
by the regiment. This was followed by the entire
overthrow and defeat of the French army, with the
loss of its cannon, ammunition, and baggage. The
<span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span> had four men and six
horses killed; Lieutenant Stewart was wounded
in the body by a musket ball, but subsequently
recovered; two men of the regiment were also
wounded. Lieutenant-Colonel Holmes received a
gold medal for his distinguished conduct in this
action; and His Royal Highness the Prince Regent
commanded the word '<span class="smcap">Vittoria</span>' to be placed on
the standards of the regiment.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span> were next engaged
in the blockade of Pampeluna; and they were
formed up in reserve at the foot of the mountains
during the severe contest in the <em>Pyrenees</em>, on the
29th and 30th of July, but the scene of action was
too mountainous for cavalry to engage.</p>

<p>The regiment remained in front of Pampeluna
until the 17th of September, when it moved to
Milagro, on the Ebro, where a remount, consisting
of three officers, two serjeants, twenty-four private<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
men, and fifty-five horses, joined from England,
under the command of Major Watts. On the 20th
of November the regiment occupied Valtierra and
Arquedas, on the Ebro, where it remained in reserve
during the winter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1814</div>

<p>The movements of the allies were now attended
with success in every quarter, and part of the
army had already entered France. Early in the
spring of 1814 the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span> advanced,
by Pampeluna and Toloso, through the
Pyrenean mountains, to St. Jean de Luz, in France,
where they arrived on the 11th of March, and were
there joined by a further remount of three officers,
two serjeants, eleven private men, and fifty-four
horses.</p>

<p>The regiment was now actively engaged in operations
against the enemy, and on the 22nd of March
had an affair with a body of French troops at <em>St.
Guadens</em>, in which it captured many prisoners.
Advancing up the country it was almost constantly
confronting the enemy. The battle of <em>Toulouse</em>
was fought on the 10th of April; but the brigade,
of which this regiment formed a part, being attached
to Sir Rowland Hill's division, was not
engaged. The enemy having retired from Toulouse,
the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span> marched
through that city, and on the 13th of April, being
the regiment in advance, received the last shot of
the enemy. The armies of the Continental Powers
having penetrated France by the opposite frontier,
had advanced to the capital, Napoleon Bonaparte
was compelled to abdicate the throne of France,
and the brilliant achievements of the British troops
were crowned with the restoration of peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span> were quartered
at Viellevigne; on the 25th of April they were at
Nalloux and the neighbouring villages; and on the
25th of May occupied Venargne and adjacents.
On the 2nd of June they commenced their march
from the southern to the northern extremity of
France, passing through many of the principal
cities and towns, and finally arrived at Calais,
where they embarked for England on the 20th of
July, and landed at Dover and Ramsgate on the
following day, after an absence of five years
and three months. The loss which the regiment
sustained from fatigue, privation, disease, and the
various incidents of war, may be estimated by
reference to the number of men and horses sent
out from time to time to replace those which had
fallen, or were become unfit for service.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of July the regiment assembled at
Canterbury, and marched from thence to Huntingdon;
where two troops were reduced, and the
numbers of the remaining eight troops considerably
decreased. On the 12th of August it
marched for York, where it arrived on the 23rd,
and occupied Leeds and Sheffield as out-stations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1815</div>

<p>His Royal Highness the Prince Regent, appreciating
the gallant and important services of the
regiment, which, in connexion with the other
corps of the army, and of the forces of the Allied
Sovereigns, had been so conducive to the restoration
of peace, was graciously pleased to direct that
the word '<span class="smcap">Peninsula</span>' should be borne as an
honorary distinction on the standards of the <span class="smcap">Third</span>,
or <span class="smcap">Prince of Wales' Regiment of Dragoon
Guards</span>, in commemoration of its services in Por<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>tugal,
Spain, and France, under the command of
Field-Marshal his Grace the Duke of Wellington.
The Prince Regent's pleasure on this subject was
communicated to the regiment by the Adjutant-General
in a letter dated the 6th of April, 1815.</p>

<p>The return of Bonaparte to France, and the
sudden breaking out of the war in 1815, occasioned
an augmentation of two troops to be made
to the establishment; and immediately after the
battle of <em>Waterloo</em> the regiment received orders
to proceed on foreign service.</p>

<p>From York it marched to Northampton, where it
arrived on the 5th of July, and having established
a dépôt of four troops at that place, under the command
of Major Watts, the remaining six troops
proceeded to Ramsgate and Dover, where they
embarked on the 21st of July, under the command
of Lieutenant-Colonel Holmes.</p>

<p>Having landed at Ostend on the 23rd and 24th
(with the loss of one horse only on the passage),
the regiment marched from thence to Drouges,
near Ghent, where it arrived on the 25th. Advancing
up the country it entered France, and
proceeding to the vicinity of Paris, took part in
several grand military spectacles and reviews, at
which the sovereigns of Russia, Prussia, Austria,
and France were present.</p>

<p>On the 29th of October the regiment marched
to Fontenoy, occupying also Guitrancourt and
St. Cyr; and while stationed there it transferred
108 horses to the 1st and 2nd Dragoon Guards,
3rd Dragoons, and 13th Light Dragoons; also
exchanged 54 others. Leaving Fontenoy on the
17th of December, the regiment marched for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Abbeville, where it arrived on the 28th of that
month.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1816</div>

<p>After the definitive treaties between France and
the allied powers were settled, the British troops
withdrew from France, excepting a small army of
occupation. The <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span> left
Abbeville on the 15th of January, 1816, arrived
at Calais on the 24th, where they immediately embarked,
and landed at Dover and Ramsgate on
the following day, from whence they proceeded to
Romford, and a reduction of two troops was again
made in the establishment. On the 12th of February
the service troops marched for Leicester,
where they arrived on the 19th, and joined the
regimental dépôt. On the 23rd the regiment
marched for Manchester, where the head-quarters
arrived on the 29th, and detachments occupied
Sheffield, Huddersfield, Leeds, and Liverpool. In
May a draft of 184 horses was received from the
Royal Artillery.</p>

<p>Towards the end of June the regiment embarked
at Liverpool for Ireland, and having landed at
Dublin, marched to Ballinarobe, Gort, Sligo,
Castlebar, Roscommon, and Dunmore; and in
August a further reduction was made in the establishment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1817</div>

<p>In March, 1817, Lieutenant-Colonel Holmes
received the ribbon and badge of a Companion of
the most Honourable Military Order of the Bath,
which was transmitted to him, in compliance
with the commands of his Royal Highness the
Prince Regent, by the Duke of York, in a letter
bearing date the 11th of March, 1817.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1818<br />1819</div>

<p>In June, 1818, the regiment marched to Dublin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Philipstown, and Tullamore. In the early part of
the following year the several troops assembled at
Dublin, and a further reduction was made in the
establishment. During the summer the regiment
marched to Cahir, Carrick-on-Suir, Clogheen,
Fethard, and Newross.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1820</div>

<p>On the 25th December the facing was altered
from <em>blue</em> to <em>yellow</em>, and the lace from <em>yellow</em> to
<em>white</em>: but the officers were subsequently allowed
to retain the gold lace as previously worn.</p>

<p>The regiment embarked at Donaghadee in August,
1820, landed at Portpatrick, and proceeded
from thence to Hamilton, Glasgow, and Paisley.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1821</div>

<p>During the summer of 1821, it marched to
Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Carlisle, and Penrith; but
returned to Hamilton, Glasgow, and Paisley in
August; when the establishment was reduced to
six troops&mdash;total, 27 officers, 335 non-commissioned
officers and privates, and 253 troop horses.</p>

<p>In November the regiment proceeded to Piershill
barracks, Ayr, Greenock, and Perth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1822</div>

<p>The whole assembled at Edinburgh in June,
1822, for the purpose of attending his Majesty
King George IV., on his visit to Scotland;
on the 18th of August had the honor of being
present when his Majesty landed at Leith; and
the King was graciously pleased to promote Captain
Story (who was the senior captain in garrison)
to the rank of Brevet-Major. His Majesty afterwards
reviewed the regiment on the sands near
Musselburgh, and expressed his approbation of its
appearance and discipline.</p>

<p>In September of the same year the regiment
returned to England, and was stationed at New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>castle-upon-Tyne
and Carlisle; where it was frequently
called upon to suppress tumults and disorders,
and to protect the coal and shipping
interests during the disturbances amongst the
keelmen of the river; which service it performed
to the entire satisfaction of Major-General Sir
John Byng, who was in command of the district;
and also of the civil authorities of the place.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1823<br />1824</div>

<p>During the summer of 1823 the regiment
marched to York and Leeds, and subsequently to
Manchester, Nottingham, and Sheffield. In the
spring of the following year three troops and head-quarters
were removed to Liverpool, where they
remained about a week, after which the head-quarters
returned to Manchester. In April the
silk-weavers at Macclesfield manifested a disposition
to riot, but by the timely appearance of a
detachment of the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span>
tranquillity was restored.</p>

<p>In this year the regiment was supplied with
helmets and bear-skin crests. In June it proceeded
to Ireland, and having landed at Dublin,
marched to Cahir, Limerick, and Clogheen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1825</div>

<p>The Colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span>
having become vacant by the decease of General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Vyse, His Majesty conferred the appointment on
General Sir William Payne, Baronet, who afterwards
took the name of Galway, his commission
bearing date the 2nd June, 1825.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1826</div>

<p>Towards the end of the same month the regiment
marched to Dublin, where it remained until
the following spring, when it returned to Cahir,
Limerick, and Clogheen. Several changes of
quarters were made during the summer, and
eventually the troops were stationed at Cork and
Fermoy, with detachments in aid of the civil
authorities and officers of the revenue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1827<br />1828</div>

<p>In the autumn of 1827 the regiment marched
to Newbridge. In the early part of the following
year four troops proceeded to Dublin, and subsequently
to Dundalk and Belturbet. In April it
embarked at Donaghadee, landed at Portpatrick,
and marched to Piershill barracks and Glasgow,
and subsequently occupied Perth, with detachments
in aid of the officers of the revenue at
Forfar and Cupar Angus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1829<br />1830</div>

<p>During the summer of 1829 the regiment
marched to Birmingham and Coventry. In October
one troop was employed in assisting the
civil power at Atherstone; and in the beginning
of April, 1830, another troop was similarly employed
at Pamswick. In the middle of April
the regiment marched to Exeter, Trowbridge,
Dursley, and Wotton-under-Edge. Towards the
end of the year several changes of quarters took
place, and detachments were furnished in aid
of the civil authorities during the election of
Members of Parliament. Eventually the regiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
was stationed at Dorchester and Blandford; and
an addition of three horses was made to the
establishment of each troop.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1831</div>

<p>On the 22nd of April, 1831, his Majesty conferred
the Colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon
Guards</span> (vacant by the decease of General Sir
William Payne) on Lieut.-General Sir Samuel
Hawker, G.C.H.</p>

<p>In June one troop was actively employed in
suppressing the violent proceedings of the pit
and ironfoundry men at Merthyr-Tidvil and its
vicinity. During the remainder of this year the
regiment was almost constantly in motion to support
the civil power, and to prevent the occurrence
of serious breaches of the peace. The
labouring classes, being strongly excited by designing
men, frequently violated the laws, and
burnt great quantities of agricultural property.</p>

<p>The subject of a reform in parliament had created
considerable discussion and interest throughout
the country, and the resistance of certain members
to the extensive changes proposed in the representation
and elective franchise had excited the indignation
of the populace in various places, particularly
at <em>Bristol</em>, of which city one of the members,
Sir Charles Wetherall, was recorder. He arrived
at Bristol on Saturday the 29th of October, to
open the King's commission, when he was assailed
by an outrageous rabble, with insult, menace, and
showers of stones. The tumult increasing, the
Riot Act was read, when the mob became more
violent than before,&mdash;broke open the Mansion-house,
demolished the windows, doors, and furniture,
and prepared to set the building on fire. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
this moment a troop of the 14th Light Dragoons
arrived, and the Mansion-house was saved, and
the rioters dispersed. On Sunday the mob again
assembled, and plundered the Mansion-house,
where they found a quantity of wine and spirits,
and they soon became intoxicated. In this state
the rioters became more furious than before. They
broke open the Bridewell, liberated the prisoners,
and set fire to the building. The new gaol and
the Gloucester county prison were treated in like
manner. The Bishop's palace, the Mansion-house,
the Excise-office, the Custom-house, and many
private dwellings, were plundered and set on fire,
and several of the drunken rioters perished in the
flames. In the midst of this scene of tumult and
conflagration a detachment of the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon
Guards</span> was seen endeavouring to arrest
the progress of the mobs. Unfortunately the
magistrates did not give the necessary instructions;
and as the soldiers were proceeding in one direction,
destruction was going on in another, and
property to an immense amount was destroyed,
before the exertions of the civil and military
powers restored order. About one hundred of
the rioters were killed or wounded before the
tumult was suppressed; and one hundred and
eighty were committed to prison, of whom fifty
were capitally charged with rioting and burning.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1832</div>

<p>In 1832 the regiment was stationed at Brighton,
Chichester, and Worthing; and in August four
troops proceeded to London, occupied Regent's
Park barracks, and performed the duties of the
metropolis during the absence of the Life
Guards for the purpose of being reviewed by His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Majesty. After performing this duty, the four
troops returned to Brighton and Chichester.</p>

<p>In the early part of November, King William
IV. and Queen Adelaide arrived at Brighton, and
on the 30th of that month the officers of the regiment
had the honour of dining with their Majesties
at the Royal Pavilion: the band was in attendance
during the evening, and also on several other occasions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1833</div>

<p>The regiment received orders to march to Dorchester
in January, 1833; and, before it quitted
Brighton, Lieut.-Colonel Story was honoured with
the King's most gracious commands&mdash;'To make
known to the officers, non-commissioned officers,
and privates, His Majesty's entire approbation of
their conduct while at Brighton.'</p>

<div class="sidenote">1834</div>

<p>From Dorchester the regiment proceeded, in
March of the same year, to Birmingham, where it
remained the succeeding twelve months. In April,
1834, it marched to Liverpool, and, having embarked
at that port for Ireland, landed in Dublin
on the 1st of May.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1835<br />1836</div>

<p>After passing one year at Dublin, the regiment
marched, in May, 1835, to Longford; remained
at this station during the following twelve months,
and proceeded, in May, 1836, to Ballincollig.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1837<br />1838</div>

<p>Having spent a period of three years in Ireland,
the regiment marched to Cork; embarked from
thence on the 14th of June, 1837, for England;
landed at Bristol on the following day, and proceeded
to Ipswich; where it has remained until
the spring of 1838, which brings the record of
this distinguished corps to a conclusion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>Few cavalry regiments have been favoured with
a greater number of opportunities of acquiring
honour by deeds of valour in action with the
enemies of the British nation than the <span class="smcap">Third, or
Prince of Wales' Regiment of Dragoon
Guards</span>: it has served under <span class="smcap">Marlborough</span>
and <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>&mdash;names immortalized in the
history of Europe. As a regiment of <span class="smcap">Horse</span>, it
fought at Blenheim, Ramilies, and Malplaquet&mdash;battles
which shed lustre on the British arms.
As a corps of <span class="smcap">Dragoon Guards</span>, it gained
immortal fame at Corbach and Warbourg, and
signalized itself in other actions in Germany. In
Flanders, under his Royal Highness the Duke of
York, it earned new laurels; and, in the Peninsular
War, it added to its previous reputation by its gallant
bearing on all occasions, particularly at the
battle of Albuhera. On this subject, Viscount Beresford
observed, in a letter to the Adjutant-General,
'The conduct of this regiment, during the period
it was under my command, deserved, on all occasions,
and especially at the battle of Albuhera,
my highest encomiums.' On home service, it
has acquired the confidence and approbation of its
sovereign, and the commendations of the general
officers under whose command it has been placed.</p>

<p class="center smcap">Thomas Earl of Plymouth,</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 15th July, 1685.</em></p>

<p class="noindent">On the decease of <span class="smcap">Thomas</span>, sixth <span class="smcap">Lord Windsor</span>, on the
6th of December, 1642, without issue, his titles became
extinct, but his estates descended to his nephew <span class="smcap">Thomas
Windsor Hickman</span>, then in the fifteenth year of his age.
The rebellion breaking out immediately, this youth displayed
an ardent and chivalrous spirit, with a fixed
devotion to his sovereign and to monarchical government.
He raised and maintained a troop of horse at his own
charge, with which he joined King Charles I., and became
an active and an enterprising leader amongst the
loyalists, distinguishing himself in many skirmishes and
sharp encounters with the rebels. At the battle of
<em>Naseby</em>, fought on the 14th of June, 1645, he commanded
a regiment of horse, and stoutly charged through
and through the enemy's ranks; when the King, taking
special notice of the gallantry of this youth, commanded
that that regiment, with its valiant leader, should be the
royal guard for that day. The King's army was, however,
defeated, and his Majesty retreated to Ashby-de-la-Zouch,
in Leicestershire; where, remembering the signal
service of that regiment of horse, and the particular merits
of Colonel Windsor Hickman, he gave command for
preparing a patent for reviving the title and dignity of
<span class="smcap">Lord Windsor</span>, to the said <span class="smcap">Thomas Windsor Hickman</span>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
But, from that period, a series of disasters befalling the
unfortunate monarch, nothing further transpired on that
subject until the restoration of King Charles II., when
his Majesty, taking into consideration the many good
services performed by this <span class="smcap">Thomas Windsor Hickman</span>
throughout the whole course of that rebellion (amongst
which the raising of the siege of his Majesty's garrison of
High-Ercall, in Shropshire, was not the least), as also
his sufferings in the Royal cause, by imprisonment,
plunder, and otherwise, did, by a declaratory patent
under the great seal, bearing date the 16th of June,
1660, restore unto him the title and dignity of <span class="smcap">Lord
Windsor</span>, with the same rank and precedence which
were held by his maternal uncle, Thomas, late Lord
Windsor.</p>

<p>On the 18th of July following, <span class="smcap">Lord Windsor</span> was
appointed lord-lieutenant of Worcestershire; and, in
1665, he was sent governor to Jamaica. During his
stay in the West Indies, <span class="smcap">Lord Windsor</span> assembled the
troops under his command, defeated 3000 Spaniards,
and captured seven ships in the harbour of St. Jago de la
Cuba; and eventually took the town and castle, with the
cannon of the works, and five hundred barrels of powder.
Not enjoying his health in that climate, his Lordship
received permission to return to England; and, after his
arrival, he was appointed one of his Majesty's Privy
Council in Ireland. At length his Majesty, taking into
consideration the eminent services of Lord Windsor,
advanced him to the dignity of <span class="smcap">Earl <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'of'">of</ins> Plymouth</span>, by
patent dated the 6th of December, 1682.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Earl <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'of'">of</ins> Plymouth</span> enjoyed the affection and
confidence of King James II., who conferred upon him
the Colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Fourth Regiment of Horse</span> (now
3rd Dragoon Guards), and also appointed him one of the
Privy Council. He died on the 3rd of November, 1687,
and was buried in the church of Tarbick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Sir John Fenwick, Bart.</span>,</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 6th November, 1687</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">John Fenwick</span>, Esq., was a loyal cavalier in the reign of
King Charles II., and an officer of the Queen's Troop
(now Second Regiment) of Life Guards. He served
under the Duke of Monmouth, with the French army, in
the Netherlands, during the campaigns of 1672 and
1673. In the succeeding year he obtained permission to
proceed to Holland; and, in 1675, he was appointed
Colonel of an Irish regiment in the Dutch service (the
present Fifth Foot). He served with his regiment during
the campaign of that year under the Prince of Orange;
and, in the following summer, he served at the siege of
Maestricht, where he was severely wounded while on
duty with his regiment in the trenches (2nd August,
1676). Shortly afterwards some angry words passed
between him and the Prince of Orange, when he quitted
the Dutch service, and, returning to England, resumed
his duties in the Life Guards; and, from this period, a
personal aversion is said to have existed between his
Highness and Colonel Fenwick. The Colonel was, however,
well received at the British court: he succeeded, on
the decease of his father, to the dignity of a baronet,
and, in 1678, King Charles II. promoted him to the rank
of Brigadier-General, and gave him the Colonelcy of a
newly-raised regiment of foot, with which he proceeded
to Flanders; but, after the peace of Nimeguen, this
regiment was disbanded, and Sir John again resumed
his duties in the Life Guards, in which corps he rose to
the rank of Lieutenant and Lieutenant-Colonel. In 1686
he was appointed Inspecting General of Cavalry (jointly
with Brigadier-General Sir John Lanier), and, after the
decease of the Earl of Plymouth in 1687, he was promoted
from the Life Guards to the Colonelcy of the
<span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>. He was also Governor of Holy Island,
and a Member of Parliament for the county of Northumberland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir John Fenwick appears to have been devotedly
attached to the Stuart dynasty; and, having been
advanced to the rank of Major-General in November,
1688, he refused to take the required oath to the Prince
of Orange at the Revolution, and his regiment was given
to Viscount Colchester. After the accession of William
and Mary, Sir John did not abstain from corresponding
with the dethroned monarch. After the decease of
Queen Mary, he assisted in planning an insurrection in
favour of King James, which was to have broken out in
the winter of 1695-6, and he agreed to command a body
of horse. At this time a plot for the assassination of
King William was discovered, and Sir John Fenwick
was apprehended at New Romney, on his way to France,
on an attainder of high treason, and was brought to
trial before the Parliament. No proof of his guilt was
produced; but the written evidence of a witness on a
former trial was produced against him. This proceeding
gave rise to much altercation amongst the members; but
the Bill was at length carried by a majority of seven:
forty-one Lords, including eight Prelates, entering a
protest against the decision. An offer of pardon was
made to him by the Peers, on condition that he would
make a full discovery; but he chose to suffer death rather
than incur the disgrace of becoming an informer. He
was beheaded on Tower Hill on the 28th of January,
1697. At the time of his execution, he professed his
attachment to King James, and expressed a wish that
the exiled monarch might be restored to the throne.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Richard Viscount Colchester</span>,</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 31st December, 1688</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent">This nobleman entered the Life Guards, in which corps
he attained, in the spring of 1686, the rank of Lieutenant
and Lieutenant-Colonel. He was one of the first officers
who joined the Prince of Orange at the Revolution in
1688, and he took with him several private gentlemen of
the fourth troop of Life Guards. On the removal of Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
John Fenwick, the Colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Fourth Regiment
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'of'">of</ins> Horse</span> was conferred on Viscount Colchester, who
attended King William in Ireland, and was at the battle
of the Boyne and the siege of Limerick. His lordship
was removed to the Colonelcy of the Third Troop of Life
Guards in 1692, which gave him the privilege of taking
the court duty of Gold Stick, and he served with distinction
under his Majesty in several campaigns on the
Continent. He succeeded to the title of <span class="smcap">Earl Rivers</span>
in 1694; and, in the early campaigns of the wars of
Queen Anne, he served under the celebrated John Duke
of Marlborough. In 1706 he commanded an expedition
designed to make a descent on the French coast; but
the fleet having been delayed by contrary winds until the
design was frustrated, he proceeded to Spain, where he
left the troops under the command of the Earl of Galway,
and afterwards returned to England. He was
appointed to the Colonelcy of the Royal Horse Guards
in 1712; and died in the same year.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">John Lord Berkeley</span>,</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 23d January, 1692</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent">This nobleman was the son of Sir John Berkeley, a
descendant from the ancient Barons of Berkeley Castle
(and a distinguished loyalist in the time of Charles I.
and Charles II.), who was raised to the peerage by the
title of <span class="smcap">Lord Berkeley, of Stratton</span>. Having entered
the Royal Navy, he rose to the rank of Admiral, and
was also Colonel of a regiment of Marines (afterwards
disbanded) in the reign of Charles II. It was common
at this period for the Admirals to hold commissions in
the army. After the Revolution of 1688, Lord Berkeley
sustained a military character, and was appointed Colonel
of the <span class="smcap">Fourth Regiment <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'of'">of</ins> Horse</span> in January, 1692.
He, however, quitted the regiment in the following year,
and held a naval command, in which he distinguished
himself against the French. Lord Berkeley died on the
29th of February, 1697.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Cornelius Wood</span>,</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 24th January, 1694</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent">This officer was the son of a clergyman of Staffordshire,
and having been unfortunate in commerce, in the reign
of Charles II., he entered Queen Catherine's Troop (now
Second Regiment) of Life Guards, as a private gentleman,
at the time when the ranks of that corps contained
many young men of distinction who were aspiring to
commissions in the regular army. Mr. Wood evinced great
attention in acquiring a knowledge of his profession, which,
with a strict performance of all his duties, soon procured
him the approbation and favour of Sir Philip Howard, the
Captain and Colonel, and of Sir George Hewytt, the
Lieutenant-Colonel, through whose recommendation he
was advanced to the post of Sub-Corporal with the rank
of Cornet; and, on the 15th of June, 1685, King James
II. promoted him to the degree of Corporal (or Brigadier)
with the rank of Lieutenant. During the remainder
of the short reign of James II., Brigadier Wood is said
to have witnessed with regret the violent conduct of the
King; and, being faithful to the principles which he had
imbibed in his youth, he adhered to the Protestant interest
at the Revolution in 1688, and was promoted, by
King William III., to the Captaincy of a troop in the
Ninth Horse (now Sixth Dragoon Guards), the command
of which corps had been conferred on his friend,
Sir George Hewytt, afterwards Viscount Hewytt. The
intrepidity which he displayed in the wars in Ireland and
in Flanders<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> gained him a high reputation, and he was
promoted to the Lieutenant-Colonelcy of the regiment
on the 31st of December, 1692. His gallant conduct
at the battle of Landen, on the 19th of July, 1693,
attracted the attention of King William, who complimented
him on his bravery, made him a present of a
valuable charger, and, in January of the following year,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
His Majesty promoted him to the Colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Fourth
Horse</span>; at the head of which regiment he served in
Flanders until the peace of Ryswick in 1697.</p>

<p>On the breaking out of the war in 1702, Colonel Wood
was promoted to the rank of Brigadier-General, and sent
with his regiment to Holland, to serve under the celebrated
John Duke of Marlborough; and, in the following
year, he was advanced to the rank of Major-General.
The several campaigns of this war form a glorious era in
the military history of Great Britain; and few officers
acquired greater celebrity than <span class="smcap">General Wood</span>. In
the annals of that war his name is associated with
exploits of particular brilliancy; and he is mentioned
among those who materially contributed to the victories
at Schellenberg, Blenheim, and Ramilies. At the latter
engagement, the Duke of Bavaria and Marshal Villiers
narrowly escaped being taken prisoners by him, as more
particularly stated in the record of the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon
Guards</span>. He also distinguished himself at the battle of
Malplaquet, and in several skirmishes.</p>

<p>The death of this distinguished officer was occasioned
by the fall of his horse in May, 1712.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Thomas Viscount Windsor</span>,</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 18th May, 1712</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Lord Thomas Windsor</span>, second son of Thomas Earl of
Plymouth, the first Colonel of this regiment, served with
distinction in the army in the wars of King William III.,
and, on the 23rd of January, 1692, he obtained the Lieutenant-Colonelcy
of the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>. On the 16th
of February, 1694, he was appointed to the Colonelcy of
a newly-raised regiment of horse, which was disbanded
after the peace of Ryswick. On the 19th of June, 1699,
he was advanced to the peerage of Ireland by the title of
<span class="smcap">Viscount Windsor</span>. After the decease of the Earl of
Macclesfield, in 1701, the Colonelcy of the Tenth Horse
was conferred upon Viscount Windsor, who was promoted,
on the 9th of March, 1702, to the rank of Brigadier-General,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
and on 1st of January, 1704, to that of Major-General.
In October of the latter year his regiment was
given to Samuel (afterwards Lord) Masham. The rank
of Lieutenant-General was, however, conferred upon his
Lordship in 1707; in April, 1711, he was restored to
the Colonelcy of the Tenth Horse; and in December of
the same year, he was made an English Peer, by the
title of Baron Montjoy, of the Isle of Wight. The
Colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span> was conferred upon his
Lordship in 1712; from which he was removed, by King
George I., in 1717: he died in 1738.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">George Wade</span>,</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 19th March, 1717</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent">This officer engaged in the profession of arms in the
reign of William III., and, after serving the Crown with
zeal and fidelity for many years, he was eventually
rewarded with the highest honours of the service. His
first commission was dated the 26th of December, 1690;
and he served in the Netherlands under King William
until the peace of Ryswick. Having rose to the rank of
Lieutenant-Colonel of the Tenth Regiment of Foot, he
proceeded, on the breaking out of the war of the Spanish
succession, with the expedition to Portugal, and was
appointed Adjutant-General to the army commanded by
the Earl of Galway, with the brevet rank of Colonel, by
commission dated the 22nd of August, 1704. After the
death of Colonel Duncasson, who was killed at the siege
of Valencia de Alcantara, in May, 1705, the command
of the Thirty-third Foot was conferred upon <span class="smcap">Colonel
Wade</span>, by commission bearing date the 9th of June in
the same year. Continuing to serve in the Peninsula,
and, by his personal exertions, gaining laurels even in
the midst of the reverses and disasters which befell the
army, he was promoted to the rank of Brigadier-General
on the 1st of January, 1708; and, in the following year
he received a complimentary communication from King
Charles III. (afterwards Emperor of the Romans), with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the commission of Major-General in Spain; in which
country he served during the remainder of the war, and
highly distinguished himself in the command of a brigade
of infantry at the battle of Saragossa in 1710.</p>

<p>On the accession of King George I., Brigadier-General
Wade was advanced to the rank of Major-General; and,
proving a faithful and trustworthy servant to the Crown,
at a time when jacobin principles were prevalent in the
nation, his Majesty appointed him, on the 19th of March,
1717, Colonel of the <span class="smcap">Fourth Horse</span>. In 1724 he commanded
in Scotland; and some important roads through
the Highlands were constructed under his direction and
superintendence. He was promoted to the rank of
Lieutenant-General on the 7th of March, 1727; to that
of General on the 2nd of July, 1739; and he was further
advanced to the rank of Field-Marshal on the 14th of
December, 1743. In the following year, this distinguished
veteran, being then in the seventy-sixth year
of his age, engaged in active service, and commanded
the British troops in the Netherlands in the campaign of
1744, but afterwards returned to England; and, in the
succeeding year, he was appointed Commander-in-Chief,
during the absence of his Royal Highness the Duke of
Cumberland on the Continent. In the autumn of the
same year a rebellion broke out in Scotland, and Field-Marshal
Wade commanded an army in Yorkshire, and
was actively engaged in the pursuit of the rebels after
their retreat from Derby. He was Lieutenant-General
of the Ordnance and one of his Majesty's Privy Council;
and, after serving the Crown a period of fifty-eight years,
died on the 14th of February, 1748, in the eightieth year
of his age.</p>

Deputy-Governor of Carlisle in March, 1725; rose to
the rank of Colonel on the 23rd of April, 1734; and
was appointed Aide-de-camp to King George II. He
was promoted, on the 1st of November, 1738, to the
command of the Nineteenth Regiment of Foot; was
appointed Brigadier-General on the 18th of February,
1742, and proceeded with the army, commanded by the
Earl of Stair, to Flanders, in the same year. He was
promoted to the rank of Major-General on the 4th of
July, 1743; to that of Lieutenant-General on the 9th of
August, 1747; and, in March, 1748, to the Colonelcy
of the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span>. In June, 1749, he

the Bath; and, in March, 1765, he was promoted to the

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Charles Howard</span> was Governor of Forts George

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Lord Robert Manners</span>, son of John second Duke of

was appointed Lieutenant in May, 1740; and Captain
and Lieutenant-Colonel in the First Foot Guards on the
22nd of April, 1742. In December, 1747, he was promoted
to the rank of Colonel, and appointed Aide-de-camp
to King George II.; and, in 1751, his Majesty
gave him the Colonelcy of the Thirty-sixth Regiment of
Foot. The rank of Major-General was conferred upon
Lord Robert Manners on the 7th of February, 1757;
that of Lieutenant-General on the 7th of April, 1759;
and, in 1765, King George III. gave him the Colonelcy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Philip Honeywood</span>,</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 7th June, 1782</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Philip Honeywood</span>, having entered the army at an
early age, rose to the rank of Major in the King's
Dragoons, now Third Light Dragoons, with which corps
he proceeded to Flanders in 1742, and displayed great
gallantry at the battle of Dettingen on the 26th of June,
1743, where his regiment was warmly engaged with the
French household troops and suffered severely. Major
Honeywood received five wounds in this action, and,
being thought dead, he was stripped by some plunderers,
and lay in that state six hours on the field of battle. He,
however, revived, and, having recovered of his wounds,
resumed his regimental duties, and was at the battle of
Fontenoy on the 11th of May, 1745. In the autumn of
the same year the rebellion broke out in Scotland, when
the King's Dragoons were ordered to return to England;
and, on the flight of the rebels from Derby, the regiment,
being sent forward in pursuit, overtook the rear-guard on
Clifton Moor, in Lancashire, on the 19th of December,
and a sharp action ensuing, Lieutenant-Colonel Honeywood
again displayed his wonted bravery, and was
severely wounded in the shoulder. He, however, recovered;
and, on the 17th of March, 1752, was promoted
to the rank of Colonel in the army; and, in April, 1755,
King George II. gave him the Colonelcy of the Twentieth
Regiment of Foot; from which he was removed, in
May of the following year, to the Ninth Dragoons. He
was promoted to the rank of Major-General on the 17th
of May, 1758; and, on the 5th of April in the following
year, he obtained the Colonelcy of the Fourth Irish
Horse, now the Seventh Dragoon Guards.</p>

<p>During the Seven Years' War, Major-General Honeywood
commanded a brigade of cavalry in Germany under
Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick, and performed a distin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>guished
part in many skirmishes and general engagements;
particularly at the battle of Warbourg, on the
31st of July, 1760, when he led his own regiment to the
charge with signal gallantry: the enemy was overthrown,
the most dreadful slaughter followed, and many of the
French were drowned in attempting to escape across the
river Dymel. In December of the same year he was
promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-General; and, continuing
to serve in Germany, he acquired great celebrity,
and was commended by the Commander-in-Chief in his
public despatches. After his return to England he was
advanced to the rank of General; and a vacancy occurring
in the Colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span>,
in 1782, King George III. conferred that appointment
on this distinguished veteran.</p>

<p>General Honeywood was many years Governor of
Hull; he was also Member of Parliament for Appleby;
and died on the 20th of January, 1785.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Richard Burton Philipson</span>,</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 23rd February, 1785</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Richard Burton</span> commenced his military service in the
reign of King George II.; and, having attained the rank
of Major in the Royal Dragoons on the 1st of May, 1759,
proceeded with his regiment to Germany in the spring of
the following year. In the battles, skirmishes, fatigues,
and privations of the three subsequent campaigns,
<span class="smcap">Major Burton</span> had his share; as well as in the honours
acquired by the British cavalry. After his return to England
he was permitted to take the surname of <span class="smcap">Philipson</span>.
On the 25th of January, 1771, he was appointed Lieutenant-Colonel
of the Royal Dragoons; and, in 1775, he
was appointed Colonel in the army and Aide-de-camp to
King George III. On the breaking out of the American
war, several new regiments were raised, and Colonel
Philipson was promoted to the rank of Major-General,
and appointed Colonel of the Twentieth Light Dragoons
(a corps formed of the light troops of several other regi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>ments),
on the 25th of April, 1779; from which he was
removed, on the 23rd of February, 1785, to the <span class="smcap">Third
Dragoon Guards</span>. He was promoted to the rank of
Lieutenant-General on the 28th of September, 1787;
was Member of Parliament for Eye, in Suffolk; and
died on the 19th of August, 1792.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Sir William Fawcett, K.B.</span>,</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 22nd August, 1792</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">William Fawcett</span>, who descended from the ancient
family of Fawcetts, of Shipden Hall, near Halifax,
having, from his early youth, a strong predilection for
a military life, his friends procured him an Ensign's
commission in General Oglethorp's regiment, which was
stationed in Georgia; but, a British force having been
sent to Flanders in 1742, he resigned his commission,
proceeded to the Continent, and, serving as a volunteer,
was at the battles of Dettingen and Fontenoy, where his
gallantry attracted admiration; and he was appointed
Ensign in a regiment raised by Colonel Johnstone, with
which he served until the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, in
1748, when it was disbanded.</p>

<p>Being now unemployed, he engaged in the service of
a mercantile establishment in the city of London; but,
finding his propensity to a military life invincible, he
subsequently purchased an Ensign's commission in the
Foot Guards, and, by a strict attention to his duties,
procured the favour of his Royal Highness William
Duke of Cumberland, who gave him the Adjutantcy of
the second battalion of the Third Foot Guards, which he
held, together with a Lieutenantcy, which gave him the
rank of Captain. Neglecting no opportunity of qualifying
himself for the highest posts in his profession, he
studied the German and French languages, acquired a
knowledge of Prussian and French tactics; and, in
1757, published a translation of the 'Memoirs upon the
Art of War, by Marshal Count de Saxe,' and 'The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Regulations for the Prussian Cavalry;' and, in 1759,
'The Regulations for the Prussian Infantry,' and 'The
Prussian Tactics.' These works met with great attention;
and a new edition in 1760 was also well received.</p>

<p>In the early part of the Seven Years' War, Captain
Fawcett served in Germany as Aide-de-camp to Lieutenant-General
Grenville Elliott, where he acquired a
practical knowledge of the military art; and his ardour,
intrepidity, and attention to the duties of his situation
were such, that, on the decease of Lieutenant-General
Grenville Elliott, Captain Fawcett was recommended for
the appointment of Aide-de-camp to Prince Ferdinand of
Brunswick, and he had also the offer of the same appointment
to the Marquis of Granby: he chose the
latter, and was sent to England with the despatches
which gave the account of the victory at Warbourg; on
which occasion, King George II. was highly gratified at
having the particulars of this engagement related to him
in the German language by Captain Fawcett. He was
advanced to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in the army
on the 25th of November, 1760; and, continuing to serve
in Germany, was appointed Military Secretary to the
Marquis of Granby. It is recorded that, in Lieutenant-Colonel
Fawcett's character, strength and softness were
happily blended together, and to coolness, intrepidity,
and extensive military knowledge, he added all the
requisite talents of a man of business, and the most persevering
assiduity. He was highly esteemed by every
officer on the staff of the army, and was the intimate and
confidential friend of the Marquis of Granby. He
remained on service until the peace in 1763, when he
returned to England; and his knowledge of the German
language, with the information he possessed from his
late office, was the occasion of his being employed by
King George III. as Commissary to settle the claims
made by the Allies against Great Britain for the expenses
of the war.</p>

<p>In November, 1767, he obtained a company in the
Third Foot Guards; and, in 1772, he was promoted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
the rank of Colonel in the army, and appointed Deputy
Adjutant-General to the Forces.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the American war, Colonel
Fawcett was sent to Germany to negotiate with the states
of Hesse, Hanover, and Brunswick, for a body of troops
to serve in North America, Gibraltar, and the East
Indies. He was appointed Governor of Gravesend and
Tilbury Fort on the 2nd of October, 1776. In 1777 he
was promoted to the rank of Major-General; in the
following year he was appointed Colonel of the Fifteenth
Regiment of Foot; and, in 1781, he was appointed
Adjutant-General to the Forces. The rank of Lieutenant-General
was conferred upon this valuable servant
of the Crown in 1782; in 1786 his Majesty honoured
him with the riband of the Order of the Bath; and, in
1792, gave him the Colonelcy of <span class="smcap">The Third, or Prince
of Wales' Dragoon Guards</span>.</p>

<p>In May, 1796, Sir William Fawcett was promoted to
the rank of General; and, in July following, he was
appointed Governor of the Royal Hospital at Chelsea.
The office of Adjutant-General requiring greater exertions
than his age would admit of, he obtained his
Majesty's permission to resign, and, on retiring from his
post, the King honoured him with distinguished marks
of his Royal favour and approbation. In 1799 the Duke
of York proceeded to Holland, when Sir William Fawcett
was appointed by his Majesty to be <em>General on the
Staff</em> of the Army, and to perform the duties of Commander-in-Chief
during his Royal Highness's absence.</p>

<p>He died on the 19th of March, 1804; and his funeral
was honoured with the presence of his Royal Highness
the Prince of Wales, their Royal Highnesses the Dukes
of York, Clarence, Kent, and Cambridge, and of many
noblemen and General Officers.</p>

Dragoons; obtained the rank of Lieutenant in 1766;
and, having become particularly proficient in the duties
of his profession, was appointed Adjutant of the regiment
in March of the following year. Having purchased a
Captaincy in 1771, he procured the commission of Major
in the Eighteenth Light Dragoons in 1777; and, in
1784, was appointed Lieutenant-Colonel of the King's
Dragoon Guards, which corps he brought into a high
state of discipline and efficiency; and was promoted to
the rank of Colonel in the army in 1791. On the
breaking out of the war with France, in 1793, he proceeded
with his regiment on foreign service; and, in the
following year, commanded a brigade of heavy cavalry
under his Royal Highness the Duke of York, and distinguished
himself on several occasions&mdash;particularly at the
battle of Cateau, on the 26th of April, 1794, where, after
the fall of Major-General Mansel, he commanded two
brigades throughout the remainder of the day, and materially
contributed to the victory gained on that occasion.
In October of the same year he was promoted to the
rank of Major-General; in 1797 his Majesty gave him
the Colonelcy of the Twenty-ninth Dragoons; and, in
1801, promoted him to the rank of Lieutenant-General.</p>

<p>After the decease of Sir William Fawcett, the King
conferred the Colonelcy of the <span class="smcap">Prince of Wales'

Lieutenant-Colonel of the regiment in 1794. He
served in the Netherlands under his Royal Highness the
Duke of York, and was present at the principal actions
during the campaign of 1794. In 1796 he was removed
from the Lieutenant-Colonelcy of the Royal Dragoons to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
the <span class="smcap">Third Dragoon Guards</span>; in 1798 he was promoted
to the rank of Colonel in the army; and, in 1805, he
was removed to the Tenth Light Dragoons. He was
promoted to the rank of Major-General in the same year,
and served four years on the Staff in Ireland. In November,
1807, he obtained the Colonelcy of the Twenty-third
Light Dragoons; and, in 1809, he proceeded to
Portugal with the local rank of Lieutenant-General, and
served the campaign of that year under Sir Arthur Wellesley.
He took an active part in the operations by
which the French were driven from Oporto; and commanded
the British cavalry at the memorable battle of
Talavera, fought on the 27th and 28th of July, 1809, for
which he received a medal. He was promoted to the

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
